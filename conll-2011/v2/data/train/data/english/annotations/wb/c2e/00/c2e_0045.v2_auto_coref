Every morning when <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> wash face for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Yaya</COREF> -LRB- especially when kid 's mother does that -RRB- , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Yaya</COREF> would remind <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> not to use any face wash .
The little one has always remembered what <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> once said about a TV program , which documented <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">people going to Tibet</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> would n't wash <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> faces in the morning in order to retain the grease that coped with the strong sunlight and ultraviolet radiation and would only wash off the dusts with soap at night .

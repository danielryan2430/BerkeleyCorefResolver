And says on camera the authorities have the wrong guy /.
The program about justice starts now /.
Just hours ago <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">this man</COREF> was arraigned for <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the brutal murder of <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">graduate student Imette St. Guillen</COREF></COREF> /.
Hi everyone /.
First up on the docket <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">bouncer Darryl Littlejohn</COREF> pleaded not guilty to charges <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">murdered</COREF> <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">twenty four year old Guillen</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> was found strangled and wrapped in tape /.
This was just a day after <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF> spoke out for the first time telling WCBS in New York that <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">police</COREF> have got the wrong guy /.
Not knowing <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">this woman</COREF> personally or anything you know from the little bit that <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've been told about <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was a brilliant person /.
And <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was going on with <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> life</COREF> you know to become somebody in this world /.
And <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">The family</COREF> has to be devastated /.
<COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm truly sorry what happened to <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">this young lady</COREF> /.
but <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have the wrong person /.
uh <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're going to play more of that interview /.
But joining <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> now <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">New York Sun columnist David Golden who was at the arraignment <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF></COREF> /.
All right /.
so <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">David</COREF> set the scene for us /.
Well at about two fifteen this afternoon in <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">a packed ceremonial courtroom in <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Brooklyn court</COREF></COREF> with <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Imette 's</COREF> sister</COREF> and <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">mother</COREF></COREF> sitting in <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the front row</COREF> and dozens of reporters watching <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Littlejohn</COREF> walked in /.
<COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was shackled /.
<COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did not say a word throughout the entire hearing /.
But <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> attorney</COREF> entered <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">the plea</COREF> for <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> of not guilty /.
Three charges here /.
<COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">One count of first degree murder /.</COREF>
To convict on <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> a jury would have to find that in the course of <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">killing</COREF> <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Imette</COREF> <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Littlejohn</COREF> committed some sort of sex crime also /.
To protect <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">prosecutors</COREF> have added two second degree murder charges that do not require a sex crime to have taken place /.
Earlier in the day Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and Brooklyn District Attorney Joe Hines laid out some of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the evidence in the case</COREF> in addition <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Dan</COREF> to what we 'd heard before Which was the cops had cell phone records placing <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Littlejohn</COREF> in the area where <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Imette 's</COREF> body</COREF> was found Witnesses saying that <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Littlejohn</COREF> left the Falls bar with <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Imette</COREF> And blood of <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Littlejohn 's</COREF> apparently on the ties that were binding together <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Imette 's</COREF> hands /.
<COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> heard two new pieces of forensic evidence <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> /.
From <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Littlejohn 's</COREF> diverse wardrobe apparently <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">cops</COREF> say <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> found <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">hairs matching <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">two of <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> jackets</COREF></COREF> on <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the tape that was wrapping <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Imette 's</COREF> face</COREF> and also on <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">the blanket that was wrapping <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> body</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> say diverse wardrobe /.
you know <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're talking about some weird mink coats and stuff , right /?
There 's like some sort of rabbit coat or something /?
There was <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">a rabbit coat and a mink coat</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">fibers from <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">those coats</COREF></COREF> were apparently found on both the <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">tape</COREF> as <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> said and also on <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">the blanket that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> body</COREF> was found in</COREF> /.
That 's the extent at this point of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the evidence that <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">police</COREF> say <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have</COREF> . Although <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> pointed out that <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've gone through forensically twenty percent of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the evidence that <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have collected</COREF> /.
Still waiting on <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say plenty more evidence that 's undergoing tests /.
All right <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm going to ask <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> about um any eye contact interaction uh between <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the family members</COREF> and <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Darryl Littlejohn</COREF> in a moment /.
But first here 's a little bit of sound from outside of <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">court</COREF> /.
First we 've got <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Imette 's</COREF> sister Alexandra</COREF> and then <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">Kevin O'Donnell uh <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn 's</COREF> attorney</COREF> /.
This again only hours ago /.
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Imette</COREF> was a good person a kind person /.
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> heart was full of love a love <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> willingly shared with friends and family /.
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> had a passion for life and a thirst for seeing <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> and learning new things /.
With <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Imette 's</COREF> death <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> has lost something special far too soon /.
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> heart and prayers go out to <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the family of <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Imette St. Guillen</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ca n't imagine what <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going through /.
And <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> word that <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will not put <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> on trial here /.
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will treat <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> with the same dignity that <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> lived <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> life</COREF> with /.
We 'll see about that /.
But uh <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">David</COREF> any interaction between <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the families</COREF> and <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF></COREF> in court /?
None whatsoever /.
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were on opposite sides of <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the courtroom</COREF> /.
On the right side facing in at the defense table <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Littlejohn</COREF> sat /.
As <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> said <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was shackled the whole time /.
<COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> stared forward in <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">a gray jumpsuit that was clearly the prison garb <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was issued apparently</COREF> /.
Maybe <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own clothes /.
We do n't know /.
<COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> just sat there staring forward /.
On the opposite side of <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the courtroom</COREF> sitting with some other family and friends in <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the front row</COREF> <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Alexandra St. Guillen</COREF> had <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> arm around <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mother</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> mother</COREF> was wearing those sunglasses in court that you just saw <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> wearing just now /.
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were staring straight ahead as well /.
Very very little spoken between <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /.
At one point <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. St. Guillen</COREF> the while <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">the judge</COREF> and the various lawyers were discussing future court dates was asking something about what was going on /.
All right all right /.
But that was it /.
All right /.
uh Davidson stick around uh because <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm going to get to <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> panel in a minute /.
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> 'll join us /.

<TEXT PARTNO="002">
But over the last twenty four hours a sort of war of words has erupted between <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">the police</COREF> and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">that man officially charged with <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Imette 's</COREF> murder</COREF></COREF> /.
This focus should n't really be on <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> /.
It should be on <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> finding who is really responsible for <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">this young lady 's</COREF> you know tragic death</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Imette 's</COREF> hands</COREF> and feet were bound and <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mouth</COREF> gagged with a white athletic sock /.
<COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> had been sexually abused and asphyxiated /.
Plastic packing tape covered <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> eyes <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> nose and <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mouth</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Imette</COREF> was last seen leaving <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the Falls bar</COREF> with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Darryl Littlejohn</COREF> /.
Did <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> see <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Imette St. Guillen</COREF> leave <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the bar</COREF> /?
At the end of the night yes /.
Okay um /.
Just before closing /.
Did somebody ask <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> to <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">escort</COREF> <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> out /?
Yes it was close to <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">closing time</COREF> /.
All the other patrons had left <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the bar</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was asked to <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">escort</COREF> <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> /.
Did <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /?
Yes /.
<COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's normal /.
upon <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">closing time</COREF> <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">the stragglers or whoever is remaining behind</COREF> <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have to be off the premises by four AM /.
or <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the bar</COREF> gets fined /.
So yes <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's normal /.
When <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">police</COREF> were questioning <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> did <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> volunteer to give <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> DNA</COREF> /?
Yes <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did /.
And <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> gave <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /?
Yes /.
There was never a question about <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> consenting to give <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> DNA</COREF> /.
When <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> first approached <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> at <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the Falls</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> provided <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> real name <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> real address social security number birth date so on and so forth /.
A DNA match was made with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn 's</COREF> blood on the plastic ties that bound <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> hands</COREF> /.
Red polyester rug fibers from carpeting in <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn 's</COREF> residence</COREF> along with brown mink hair from a jacket in <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> residence</COREF> and blue rabbit hair from a jacket collar in <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> residence</COREF> were consistent with rug fibers mink and rabbit hair that were found on the tapes used on <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Imette 's</COREF> head in the blanket in which <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> body</COREF> was found and in <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">the Winstar van used by <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm a likely suspect because <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have a criminal background and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was n't supposed to be there working /.
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">A cell phone used exclusively by <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF></COREF> had been in close proximity to where <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> body</COREF> was found /.
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> phone</COREF> was used there at seven thirty one PM less than an hour before <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> was reported by the nine one one call /.
Further a <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">witness</COREF> said <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> saw a van that matched the description of <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">the one used by <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF></COREF> making a u-turn at about seven thirty PM at the place <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Imette 's</COREF> body</COREF> was found /.
Finally there are no witnesses or other evidence to support <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn 's</COREF> claim that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> visited <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mother in a nursing home on the day <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Imette</COREF> was killed /.
Did <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> kill <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Imette St. Guillen</COREF> /?
No <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did not /.
Another problem of course is that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> told the Daily News reporter that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> hardly even remembered <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Imette</COREF> being there and now <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's saying oh yeah <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> walked <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> out /.

All right so <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Janna</COREF> look <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">this defense attorney</COREF> is out there uh you know talking a big game Basically saying <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've got a solid defense here /.
uh <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> took the subway home /.
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had nothing to do with <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> et cetera /.
Yeah and what 's wrong with that /?
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's going to present <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the uh some other dude defense did it</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> could work in this case <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">Dan</COREF> because we do n't have a lot of solid evidence yet linking <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF> to <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Imette St. Guillen 's</COREF> rape</COREF> or <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> murder</COREF></COREF> /.
Well <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> mean <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're ignoring <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">all the evidence that Ray Kelly 's explaining</COREF> /?
No you know what /.
because <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">that evidence</COREF> is weak at best /.
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean you could have an alternate explanation for <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">all of that</COREF> /.
The fibers transference <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's easy /.
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is /.
Oh yeah /.
No but listen /.
if the theory is that <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">raped</COREF> and <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">killed</COREF> why is n't <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn 's</COREF> DNA all over <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> body</COREF> /?
We have no semen /.
We have no evidence of rape /.
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm sorry /.
have <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> not been involved in any cases where there were rapes where there was no semen /?
eh It 's highly unlikely <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">Dan</COREF> /.
Oh really /?
Yeah /.
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean you know <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm not actually going to claim that the rapist was polite and used a condom /.
and <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think that was the case /.
Hold on /.
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> /.
Is there any evidence of that /?
No /.
So uh at worst we might have a couple of people involved in <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">this crime</COREF> /.
But we have no evidence that <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">raped</COREF> <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> /.
The theory is rape and murder /.
All right <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know /. /.
but <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">Gail</COREF> <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is what <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">defense attorneys</COREF> do /.
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">change</COREF> the subject /.
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> start saying aha prove <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">the rape</COREF> prove <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">the rape</COREF> /.
Exactly /.
And <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're /-
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Even the prosecutors</COREF> are suggesting well you know what /.
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have alternate theories here where it sounds like <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not even a hundred percent certain <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can prove <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">the rape</COREF> /.
And here 's the thing <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">Dan</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Janna</COREF> with all due respect this is /-
We 're talking about <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">a career criminal who knows about DNA who knows about criminal evidence who probably has been tried</COREF> /-
But not a career rapist /.
Well rape can be an crime of opportunity /.
And there has been <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">many many many career criminals who do not have rape on <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> rap sheet until <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have an opportunity to rape someone</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> could have used a condom /.
In addition Charles Heinz the district attorney came out today saying that <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're only twenty per cent through analyzing the physical evidence /.
And <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're also concerned /-
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have not said /-
Wait <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">Gail</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were also concerned that other cases which <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> think that <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF> might be linked to were cases where the rapist uh forced <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the women</COREF> to clean <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> off /.
Absolutely /.
And the /-
one in particular /.
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">a woman</COREF> called when <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> saw <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> picture on the television /.
um <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> test /-
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> story is exactly that /.
And <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF> whether <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's a rapist or a drug dealer or whatever <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is a career criminal /.
And <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's also a smart guy /.
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> managed to you know while <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was on parole work as a security guard which <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was n't supposed to do /.
Told people <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was a federal marshal /.
People believed <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
And now <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's telling the whole world that <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did n't do <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> when <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> absolutely did /.
And what 's more important <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">Dan</COREF> is that <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's charged with first degree murder /.
And we do n't have to prove rape to prove first degree murder /.
um First degree murder will have a sexual assault /.
but you do n't need to prove that there was semen /.
You know you do n't need to prove that there was any kind of mark left on <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> body</COREF> /.
Not according to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">this indictment</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean /-
And if you 're going to follow <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">this indictment which incidentally is the most confusing indictment <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've ever read</COREF> You 've got <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">one crime</COREF> <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">one murder</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've charged <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> three different ways /.
Under count one <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do have to prove that there was <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">a sex crime</COREF> and under three as well /.
What <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean is <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't have to bring forth any forensic evidence of <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
All right All right /.

Here 's <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Kevin O'Donnell <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF> 's attorney</COREF> on Rita 's show uh last night saying that <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> client</COREF> took <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the subway</COREF> home <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">that night</COREF> /.
So how did <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> get home <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">that night</COREF> /?
What transportation did <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> get home with /?
uh <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> took <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the subway</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">took</COREF> <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the subway</COREF> /.
Yes /.
And do we have a record of <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /?
No we 're still looking into <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says that <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> /-
Did <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> go with anybody /?
No <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> went home alone just like <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does just about every night uh when <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> leaves <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">that bar</COREF> /-
All right but <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've only got a little time left /.
and there 's <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">another issue <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want to talk about</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is that <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the DA</COREF> /-
There 's been a lot of question about uh <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the manager of <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">the bar</COREF></COREF> and the fact that <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> may not have come clean about what <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> knew early on /.
A lot of people saying uh that <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> actually <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">misled</COREF> the authorities and <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> could lead to prosecution /.
Well it seems like <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the DA</COREF> did n't seem to think <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was that big a deal today /.
Will anyone be investigated for obstruction of justice /?
Has <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Danny Dorian</COREF> been called in to witness yet /?
uh <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">The investigation</COREF> uh is certainly still going forward /.
How were <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> personally affected by the fact that there were <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">citizens of this city some of <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> relatively prominent who told cops lies and misleaded <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">this investigation</COREF></COREF> /?
Oh <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've been <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">lied</COREF> to before /.
And <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've gotten over <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
Will <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> indict <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> though /? /.
You know when that becomes a crime <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think we should all get out of this business /.
</TEXT>
<TEXT PARTNO="005">
but the problem <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Gail Abramson</COREF> is it is a crime if <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the bar manager</COREF> lied to <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">the authorities</COREF> about what happened led <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> on a wild goose chase /.
um You 're allowed to say nothing /.
but in the state of New York you 're not allowed to simply tell <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">the authorities</COREF> something that 's not true and send <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> going elsewhere /.
Exactly /.
and <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going to argue one of two things /.
Number one <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going to argue that <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had no idea that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Darryl Littlejohn aka B as <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is known at the bar</COREF> was on parole and was not allowed to be working there /.
You know number two /-
So <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going to argue ignorance /.
And <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's also going to argue that um you know <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> felt threatened or something like that . And that <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> uh was threatened by someone /.
Remember there was another bouncer that they called Kwan that never showed up again either /.
Right /.
So <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> might plead <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was a victim in this case and /-
D- /.
Yeah But <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">David Golden</COREF> <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's going to be a hard argument to make , right /?
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's going to be a tough argument in part because the original story that <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the bar manager</COREF> told cops was that <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'd seen <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Imette</COREF> leave alone /.
And then how would you just suddenly remember five or six days later that in fact <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was the one who asked <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Littlejohn</COREF> to escort <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> out /?
One other thing <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Dan</COREF> worth <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think pointing out real quickly here is that <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did hear for the first time today a potential alibi for <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Littlejohn</COREF> /.
That Ray Kelly indicated that <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't believe <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> went to visit <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mother <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">that day</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">cops</COREF> still do n't know where <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was killed /.
A lot of holes still in this case /.
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> believe that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> took <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> van</COREF> to work <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">that day</COREF> and <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> van</COREF> back <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> now know /.
So a lot still to be answered /.
All right /.
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Gail Abramstein /.</COREF>
Well we have an eye witness /-
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> got to wrap it up /.
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Gail</COREF> good to have <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> as a guest on the program /.
uh Think it 's <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> first time as a guest /.

<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've lost family /.
and <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've lost friends /.
And um as you can see <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> face has been plastered on every internet outlet every news outlet /.
And that 's not easy /.
It 's not easy feeling the guilt and the remorse and having <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> own family suffer from <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> actions /.
Do <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think that um <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> will not /?
Absolutely not /.
How do <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know for sure /?
um In <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> heart of hearts <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> definitely know /.
um <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am a strong Christian woman /.
and <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe that God has a path for <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> /.
and this is just a bump in the road /.
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe that <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm going through therapy and doing everything that <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can possible to better <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">myself</COREF> for the community and society /.
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> had sex with <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> fourteen year old student</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">all Debra Lafave</COREF> got was three years of house arrest seven years probation after entering into <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">a plea deal</COREF> /.
Now remember <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">a judge in <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">a neighboring county</COREF></COREF> said quote <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">that plea deal</COREF> shocks the conscience of the court /.
Prosecutors in <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">that county</COREF> dropped the charges /.
and so <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">the plea deal</COREF> uh stands /.
Here 's what <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">that judge</COREF> said /.
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">The victim in this case</COREF> is not a young child /.
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's now sixteen years old /.
The effect a trial of this nature might have on young children less than twelve years old therefore is not a factor /.

<TEXT PARTNO="007">
Someone who is not happy with this opinion is <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Sally who is <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">the young boy 's</COREF> mother</COREF> /.

Thanks a lot for coming on <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> /.
We appreciate it /.
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> 're welcome /.
All right so <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the judge</COREF> eh seemed uh to really be basically saying that <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> son</COREF> should be forced to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">testify</COREF> /.
Exactly /.
And on one hand <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> basically says that <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is uh you know appalled that a teacher would do this to a child /.
And on the other hand <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's saying that because you know <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's not under twelve years old /.
nobody likes to testify /.
even referred to police officers do n't like to testify /.
so um basically um You know <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needed to do <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
So um <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have to tell <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've just been mostly shocked that <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the judge</COREF> really did not appear to consider <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> son</COREF> um at all through this /.
And largely you know that was made known through <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> comments and <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> order that <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> issued /.
You know look <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> made a lot of comments yesterday on <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">this program</COREF> saying that <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> thought that a lot of people were demanding that <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> be prosecuted Were suggesting that <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> son</COREF> be forced to testify in <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was saying that the same people who are usually out there yelling and screaming for <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the victims</COREF> we 've got to protect <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the victims</COREF> are suddenly saying oh you know well We do n't really have to worry about <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">the victim</COREF> in <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> /.
Exactly /.
and there was no one that wanted <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> to serve prison time more than <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">myself</COREF> /.
And uh <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> /-
You know that was <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> original plea agreement that <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> offered to them um /.
But at the end of the day and as it got closer to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the trial</COREF> we were you know less than a week before <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">trial</COREF> , that uh <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the court tv</COREF> refusing to um /-
Which originally <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had said <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would do a delay and <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would shadow <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> face and the family members as well as <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> son</COREF> /.
Well without a delay <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> son 's</COREF> name would have ended up being said /.
um You know with thirty forty witnesses you ca n't help it /.

<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> came to <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , right /?

Anyway um <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> confronted <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did not find <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to be particularly sympathetic either /.
But here 's a little bit more of what <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> said /.
and <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want to get <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> reaction /.
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> greatest regret would probably be um the fact that <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> put <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">this young man</COREF> through <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
um <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the media</COREF> has totally um taken it out of proportion /.
And um <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's suffering even more so by <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the media 's</COREF> actions /.
<COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is a young man /.

um <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has walked outside of a door and been approached by media /.
uh <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> picture was published on the internet /.
That 's what <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm talking about /.
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Sally</COREF> it seems that <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> son</COREF> now has a great defender in <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the woman who molested <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF></COREF> /.
Well that 's what <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> find ironic that <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> appreciate <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> concern for <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> son</COREF></COREF> /.
But instead of saying <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> concern</COREF> because of what <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> did to <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> um instead <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> 's you know always blaming someone else /.
it 's really never <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> fault from what <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've seen up to this point /.
What did <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> want to hear from <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> /?
um You know <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm beyond that at this point /.
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have to tell <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> that uh when <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">all of this</COREF> first happened you know <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saw <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">this young teacher</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> is not <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> son 's</COREF> student /.
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> had never seen <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> before /.
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did n't know who we were talking about until the day <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was arrested /.
And um <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was shocked /.
And then to find out that <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's a newlywed and you know has <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> whole life</COREF> in front of <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> /.
And why in the world would someone do what <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> did to <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> son</COREF> and also you know throw <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> life</COREF> away like that /?
But <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> expected /-
You know <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> thought /-
uh At first <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wanted to talk to <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> and have <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> explain to <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> why /.
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> just wanted to understand /.
but <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm beyond that because um <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've yet to see <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">any remorse</COREF> from <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> /.
So <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> might not be capable of <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
Yeah uh <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> seems to be blaming this <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF> on <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> uh mental conditions /.
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's bipolar uh et cetera /.

<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> does have mental illnesses um /.

there 's absolutely no doubt that <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> knew exactly what <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was doing on five different occasions /.

All right <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Sally</COREF> good luck to <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> and good luck to <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> son</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> hair 's done /.
<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> had nice clothing on /.
so um certainly not someone you would think was locked in a bedroom for ten years /.
But let 's be clear about something /.
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> said <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was n't sexually abused /.
But <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> does say <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">had</COREF> sex with <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> when <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was a child , right /?
Yes and under <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF> <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> would be a crime /.
Right /.
You 're not allowed to have sex with a person who 's fourteen years old /.
um When <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> says sexually abused <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guess <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> does n't consider it rape /.
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know /.
Okay /.
uh <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> just wanted to be clear because you know if you 're <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">having</COREF> sex with a fourteen year old girl you know uh <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's against <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's against <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF> /.
uh <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">James Eckert</COREF> um let 's go though this /.
uh <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know that <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> position is that uh <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">this woman</COREF> was not forced uh to be there /.
Did <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> live in <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the house</COREF> since <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was fourteen /?
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Dan</COREF> <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know as well as <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do /-
and <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> respect <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> for that question /.
But <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm certainly not going to go into facts like that as to whether <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> lived there or <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> did n't live there /.
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know as well as <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do there <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> two sides to every story /.
And this is the side you hear from what <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> just heard and <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> /.
Well <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's why <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">'re</COREF> on <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the show</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> appreciate <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
And uh there 's <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">another side</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the side</COREF> is that we have <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">a man who has never been involved in any crime in <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> lifetime</COREF></COREF> /.

<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> entire life</COREF> <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's worked /.
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> worked as security guard for the last twelve years Never had any no problems whatsoever /.
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> lives with <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mother and dad and <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> son a twenty one year old /.

or <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will be out on bond with a two hundred dollar bond /.
And that 's about it /.
So <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> wo n't say whether <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had sex with <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> when <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was fourteen /?

If <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had been a prisoner in any way shape or form <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm sure the Allegheny County police would have charged <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> with <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">those charges</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> started going out /.
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> volunteered at a church /.

<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> said <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was for Lent /.

<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> said <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> biggest fear was that if <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> tried to escape or if <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> told <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would n't believe <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> and <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 'd be out on the street /.

uh If <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> can explain <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> to us /.
Well <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Dan</COREF> there 's really two things at play /.
In <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">Afghanistan</COREF> there is a power struggle going on between those who want to bring <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> back into the community of nations and make <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> modern and democratic country and the Islamic conservatives who have really run <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> uh for the last decade /.
Even before <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the Taliban</COREF> there was also <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">an Islamic government</COREF> /.
and many of <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">those same people</COREF> are back in power /.
And <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">Afghanistan</COREF> really represents something that 's happening in the broader Islamic world which is a tension between democratic values on one hand and Islamic values on the other hand /.
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean because the <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">Afghan constitution</COREF> article two point two says <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">followers of other religions</COREF> are free to exercise <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> faith and perform <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> religious rights within the limits of the provisions of law /.
Seems pretty straightforward /.
That 's right /.
uh And <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">article seven of <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF></COREF> also cites <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">the universal declaration of human rights which specifically says that <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> should have freedom to choose <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own religion</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's exactly right /.
But there are contradictions within <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">this constitution</COREF> /.
Article three of <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> says that no law shall eh contradict the beliefs or provisions of Islam /.
And article one thirty of <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> says that if there is not something specific in <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Afghan law</COREF> that speaks to a certain situation then <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">judges</COREF> should use <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> interpretation of Islamic law /.
In this case there is nothing in the Afghan criminal code which actually talks about the crime of apostasy or changing one 's religion /.
Well let <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> ask <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> about /-
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean since <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were involved in helping <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">create</COREF> <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> constitution</COREF> and <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> law</COREF> when <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were helping <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> do <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> did <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> foresee something like <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> maybe happening /?

uh and there were several of <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> who really advised strongly both uh to <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the Afghan government</COREF> and the people drafting <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> as well as <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> own government that there were some very potentially dangerous contradictions within <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> /.
um <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was ultimately a document that was agreed upon That was drafted by <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the Afghans</COREF> and agreed upon by <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the Afghans</COREF> /.
And in the final negotiations <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> actually made <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the document</COREF> even more Islamic and made the judiciary even more powerful um than what the original draft has done /.
So <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did foresee some of these problems /.
here 's <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">talking</COREF> about how <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> hopes to deal with <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want to listen to <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> and then ask <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> if <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think that <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going to be able to achieve <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> can <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">solve</COREF> <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">this problem</COREF> by working closely with <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the government that uh <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've got contacts with and will</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll deal with <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> diplomatically and remind people that there is something as universal as being able to choose religions /.
It is hard to believe right uh as outsiders uh that <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is a country that uh has been liberated by the United States uh that there are still many US troops there fighting the <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Taliban</COREF> et cetera and somehow uh we now have to negotiate the right of citizens there to practice Christianity /.
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> 're right <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Dan</COREF> /.
it 's a travesty um that something like <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> could happen anywhere in the world /.
And <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> really contains a very important lesson for <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> in that <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> really need to pay close attention not to just broad questions like elections but specifically the law in countries like <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> could have worked over the last four years <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe much harder to make sure that <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">Afghanistan</COREF> had a competent non-ideological and non-political judiciary /.
um And <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're really going to have to work very closely with <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the Afghans</COREF> in the future to help <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> improve <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> judicial system /.
Is it going to work /?
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean is <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> going to be able to work on <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> diplomatically as <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says and with the people that <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have contacts with and resolve <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean it sounds like what 's going to happen is <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> 's going to declare <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> mentally ill /.
Well <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> is really looking for a way out of <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have come under a tremendous amount of pressure /.
and obviously when Secretary of State Rice and <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> weigh in uh this is of uh uh extreme importance at the highest levels /.
And so <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have little doubt that <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the Afghan government</COREF> will find some way to wiggle out of <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> either by declaring <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> insane or perhaps quietly letting <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> slip out of <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> to seek asylum elsewhere /.
All right /.

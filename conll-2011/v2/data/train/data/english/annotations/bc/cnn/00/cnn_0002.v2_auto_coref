Well it has happened again /.
Even years later <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">the names</COREF> still raise a chill <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">Paducah Jonesborough Columbine</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Tonight</COREF> <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">a new town</COREF> <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">another boy</COREF> /.
but the terror is just the same /.
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">CNN 's David Mattingly</COREF> joins us now /.
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">David</COREF> what 's happening /?
<COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">Anderson</COREF> about a little after <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">two o'clock <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">a fifteen year old student wielding a hand gun</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">shot</COREF> and killed <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">an assistant prinicpal</COREF> then badly wounded <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the principal</COREF> and <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">another assistant principal</COREF></COREF> /.
and uh <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the suspect</COREF> was taken into custody after <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was subdued by staff here at <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">the high school</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was taken to a hospital where <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was treated for what appeared to be a gun shot wound to <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own hand suggesting there might have been uh a struggle going on afterwards /.
But <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">police</COREF> here <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> are continuing to look for any bit of evidence that <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can /.
As soon as <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> happened <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">the school</COREF> went into <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">a lockdown</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the students</COREF> were not allowed to leave <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> classes /.
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> went on for about two hours before <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were finally let out and everyone was finally able to figure out what had happened here /.
So many people shocked and absolutely stunned by what happened /.
so many times we have heard <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> that I ca n't believe <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> happened in <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">our small town</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">this tragdey</COREF> definitely has come to roost here after taking the life of <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">a very popular assistant principal</COREF> here <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">Anderson</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is Jacksborough Tennessee we 're talking about /.
how big a place is <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Jacksboro</COREF> /?
Um not very big at all /.
In fact when <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> asked <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the sheriff</COREF> exactly how many people were here <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could n't really tell <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> that it 's just that <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gave <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">the county at large</COREF> but there were thirteen hundred students here at <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">the school</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is the one big high school for <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">this county</COREF> /.
So not many people at all /.
Everyone knew uh the people at <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">this school</COREF> particularly <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">this administrator and assitant principal Ken Bruce</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Students</COREF> <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> saying <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was very well - liked very approachable the kind of teacher who would actually give you <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">lunch money</COREF> if you forgot to bring <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with you that day /.
So <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're talking about <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're going to be missing <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> very much in the future <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">Anderson</COREF> /.
About a little after <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">two o'clock <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">a fifteen year old student wielding a hand gun</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">shot</COREF> and killed <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">an assistant principal</COREF> then badly wounded <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the principal</COREF> and <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">another assistant principal</COREF></COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">David</COREF> do we know what time of day <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> happened /?
Shortly after <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">two o'clock <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> happened near <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the office of <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">this school</COREF></COREF> /.
In fact <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">some witnesses at <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the office</COREF></COREF> say <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> happened just right there next to <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> while <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were there trying to conduct some business at <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">the school</COREF> /.
Uh police are still trying to figure out what led up to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , why <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the student</COREF> was there at <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the office</COREF> and what exactly transpired between <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and the administrators before <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">those shots</COREF> were fired /.
All right appreciate that /.
<COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> uh just got to the scene /.
Uh it 's going to be a long night and a long couple of days as we 're trying to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">piece</COREF> together uh the information exactly what occured in those terrible moments before <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the shooting</COREF> /.
Here 's where the story and the backstory really start <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">coming</COREF> together /.
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's very much an involving process as <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">David</COREF> just said /.
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">The young man</COREF> has spoked to the police but no one is saying what <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said /.
There 's a closed crime scene out there <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> evidence still to be gathered people questioned statements taken /.
At some point the picture 's going to snap into focus <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> though we only have sketches /.

Well <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> could n't see anything because <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were all in class /.
And <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> just heard about uh <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">the student</COREF> going into <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">the office</COREF> or around <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">the office</COREF> and shooting <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the prinicpal</COREF> and the assitant principals that were there /.

Well <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> knew <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> for a while back in elemetary school but not much uh from here for a while back /.
but back in elementary school <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was an all - right person and hardly ever got into any trouble /.
Uh were <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> surprised to hear that <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> might be involved in a shooting /?

No not really /-
uh <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's been in some trouble before but nothing like <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would never think that <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would do anything like <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
Do <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know what kind of trouble <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had been in before /?
Well in middle school <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> got suspended for a year for stabbing <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Steele</COREF> with a pencil /.
<COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> stabbed somebody with a pencil /?

Thanks very much /.

<TEXT PARTNO="002">
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want to talk a little bit more now on why not why in <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> because frankly we do n't know <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> and we do n't want to speculate , <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's unknowable but why in so many other cases because even though it is too soon to tell whether <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">this one</COREF> fits a pattern there <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">a pattern</COREF> and we have seen <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> time and time again /.
Bitter experience has taught us <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
Here 's <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">CNN 's</COREF> Heidi Collins</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">Columbine</COREF> <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">Springfield</COREF> <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Pearl</COREF> <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Red Lake Minnesota</COREF> this past March and now Jacksboro Tennessee /.
It is a list that conjures up images of screaming children injured victims and gun - wielding kids /.
Different towns with tragically similar stories /.
What makes <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">these young men</COREF> snap /.
and what qualities if any do <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">school shooters</COREF> share /?
According to <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the FBI</COREF> there are dozens of risk factors when it comes to school violence /.
but there is no one definitive profile of this type of criminal /.
Most often the perpetrator is <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">a white male age eleven to eighteen who was described as feeling picked on or bullied by <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> peers</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> allow <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">boys</COREF> to be angry and aggressive /.
but <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't allow <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to express fear and sadness and other more vulnerable emotions /.
so hence when <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get rejected or <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get disappointed <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have a harder time <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">dealing</COREF> with that /.
and <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> often comes out in anger /.
Most of the <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">shooters</COREF> like you see in this video of <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Dylan Clebold</COREF> and <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Eric Harris</COREF> from <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">Columbine High School</COREF></COREF> had a fascination with firearms or violent video games /.
/.
And while there were <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">signs or warnings about <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> intentions</COREF> <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were not taken seriously at the time /.
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">The sheriff 's department</COREF> did n't respond to <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> um reported threats by <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Eric Harris</COREF> against <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> son</COREF> for thirteen months /.
Columbine would not have happened if <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had investigated <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> to begin with /.
Classmates say <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Clebold</COREF> and <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Harris</COREF> who brought terror to Littleton Colorado in nineteen ninety - eight</COREF> and <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Jeff Weiss the <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Red Lake Minnesota</COREF> teen who killed nine people and wounded seven before fatally shooting <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF> wore dark trenchcoats and were fans of <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">Marilyn Manson</COREF> /.
Kip Kinkel who killed two students in <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">Springfield Oregon</COREF> was a fan of <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">Manson 's</COREF> music as well /.
According to <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the FBI</COREF> <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">all of the shooters</COREF> may have felt the desire to defend narcissitic views of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> and had very low self - esteem /.
<COREF ID="241" TYPE="IDENT">Luke Woodham</COREF> killed two students in <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Pearl Mississippi</COREF> /.
Well <COREF ID="241" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guess you all start remembering <COREF ID="241" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> now /.
<COREF ID="241" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm probably going to get pretty famous /.
Famous for two things that seem to unite <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">all of these young men</COREF> no one believed <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were capable of committing such horrible acts and no one was able to stop <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">Heidi Collins</COREF> <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> New York /.
We hear that over and over again /.
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> never expected they could do such a thing /.

<COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Those</COREF> are the races for the governorships in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> and <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">New Jersey</COREF> /.

And in <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">New Jersey</COREF> another democratic victory /.
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">John Corzine currently a member of the United States Senate</COREF> will be the next governor of <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">New Jersey</COREF> according to <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> projections /.
<COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">One republican victory</COREF> <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is in <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</COREF> the Associated Press projects will be re-elected as the mayor of <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">A democrat turned republican /.</COREF>
so that a frustrating race for <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the democrats</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> carried <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">that state</COREF> a year ago /.
<COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">campaigned</COREF> for the republican candidate just last night <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">an election eve appearance</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will say though <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Anderson</COREF> <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think the bigger national question out of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the state of Virginia</COREF> might be that <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> helps <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the current incumbant governor Mark Warner</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Jeff</COREF> any surprises to <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> /?
No uh the most startling thing which we do n't often talk about is the sheer amount of money that these people have /.
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Mike Bloomberg</COREF> is a five billion dollar man who threw seventy million dollars into this campaign /.
There were ads in Cantonese and Russian /.
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> won a landslide /.

Whether they take <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> out on <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Governor Schwartzeneggar</COREF> in <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> could be another test of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> as well /.
<COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Jeff</COREF> /.
One quick point /.
<COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">the election that mattered for <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">next year</COREF></COREF> has already happened <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">that special election in <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the Ohio congressional district</COREF> with Cincinatti a republican district</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's what <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Jack Hannah the renown wildlife advocate</COREF> wanted to find out as <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> went in search of wild elephants /.
There 's said to be eighty elephants in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Akagera</COREF> /.
but for <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Hannah</COREF> and <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> crew</COREF></COREF> finding even one was not unlike looking for that proverbial needle in a haystack /.
Now the <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">elephant</COREF> 's back that way , right /?
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Hannah</COREF> hired a boat to take <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to a fishing village where there had been reports of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">a male elephant</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> search for hours and hours /.
and finally /-
Oh yeah <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> see <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
But even a wildlife expert like <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Hannah</COREF> was surprised to find such a mighty creature <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">submerged</COREF> in lake water /.
<COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was very unusual behavior /.
Look at that /.
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's like a submarine /.
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going to use <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> trunk /.
Whoa look at that /.
look at <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> move tha- /-
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is going fast /.
That is fast /.
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Big elephant /.</COREF>
An estimated eleven feet tall , weighing perhaps fourteen thousand pounds <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the mature bull elephant</COREF> was as big and angry as any <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">they'd</COREF> 'd seen before /.
And <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> started to pursue <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /.
That is fast /.
Remember <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">elephants</COREF> can swim everybody /.
And <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> got like a periscope /.
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know if <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's walking or swimming /.
but <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's moving /.
<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Hannah</COREF> and <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> crew</COREF></COREF> beat it to shore and to safety not realizing that in April the US embassy in Kigali had issued a warning to American tourists about a rogue elephant charging visitors /.
your trunk go like this /.
On shore <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Hannah</COREF> was greeted by <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">local kids</COREF> /.
Trunk /.
that 's it /.
that 's it /.
And in exchange for <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> kindness <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> shared <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">a little known secret about <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the rogue elephant</COREF></COREF> /.
Turns out <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">this monster of the deep</COREF> <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">was</COREF> in fact an old friend of <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the children 's</COREF> /.
and to prove <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> lured <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in with sweet words and sweet potatoes /.
Thank you so much /.
thank you /.
thank you /.
that 's something else /.
That 's all <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can tell you /.
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Akagera National Park</COREF> may not be all that <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> once was /.

they even now have the habituation of chimpanzees /.

<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're hearing from Knoxville <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the principal Gary Seal and assistant principal Jim Pierce</COREF> are both out of surgery at <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">this hour</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Both of them</COREF> are now listed in serious condition /.
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> are the two survivors of <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">this shooting</COREF> /.
A third assistant principal Ken Bruce was killed as <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">a fifteen year old student</COREF> <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">opened</COREF> fire with <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">a handgun</COREF> near the school offices /.
<COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> happened a little after two o'clock <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> /.
and as you might be able to see behind <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> with all the flashing blue lights <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the investigation</COREF> still underway /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have also learned that at <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">this hour</COREF> <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">investigators</COREF> have questioned others as to where <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">this young man</COREF> was able to get <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">a gun</COREF> and how <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was able to get <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> into <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the school</COREF> questioning others to find out if others might have been somehow connected to this case /.
But at <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">this point</COREF> most of <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the investigation</COREF> is going on inside <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the building</COREF> collecting every possible piece of evidence that <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can /.
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">The suspect</COREF> is in custody at a juvenile detention facility /.
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was taken there after being treated for what looked like a gunshot wound to <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hand</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">Investigators</COREF> are being very careful about how <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say uh this all came about /.
Uh <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not willing at <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">this point</COREF> to put any sort of A B and C sequence together /.
Uh there are some people who knew <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">this young man</COREF> who say that <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was troubled /.
but authorities will not confirm what was going through <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mind or what was happening as <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">this shooting</COREF> occurred /.
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Anderson /?</COREF>
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">David</COREF> we 've spoke uh in the last hour to a young man who knows uh <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">this young man who 's now in custody</COREF> who said that <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had been <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">suspended</COREF> previously for a year for stabbing an assitant principal with a pen or a pencil /.
Do <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know anything more about <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /?
Uh <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">authorities</COREF> will not talk about <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're hoping that <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will shed more light on <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> tomorrow /.
but <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are hearing <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">that story</COREF> from multiple students /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're not sure if <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's all part of the rumors that go around after these type of incidents do occur /.
but there seems to be some certain credibility in the widespread belief that uh <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">this student</COREF> did have problems the year prior and had problems uh as <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> came back to <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">this high school</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">David</COREF> we 're looking at <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">pictures</COREF> now of <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the suspect</COREF> being put into a police car /.
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know if <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 've seen <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">the pictures</COREF> /.
Is <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> blood on <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> shirt</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is blood on <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> shirt</COREF> /.
Again <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was treated for what looked like a gunshot wound to <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hand</COREF> suggesting that <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> might have been wounded <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> during whatever struggle that occurred after <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">these shootings</COREF> /.
Authorities tell <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> that <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had been subdued by the time the first responders arrived here so that <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was subdued by staff here at <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the school</COREF> /.
After all that happened <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the school</COREF> was in lockdown /.
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the students</COREF> were locked in <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> classes for about two hours /.
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were released uh to some very anxious parents here outside the school grounds /.
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">The school</COREF> is going to be closed for the rest of the week <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Anderson</COREF> /.
There will be <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">counseling here going on for anyone who needs <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF></COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> goes for not just <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the students</COREF> but the staff here as well /.
All right <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">David</COREF> thanks good reporting /.
As <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">David</COREF> it is an active investigation and crime scene as you can see very much uh still an active crime scene /.

Well it 's interesting <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> has said categorically <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't torture /.
<COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> also says <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">do</COREF> whatever is necessary /.
So what exactly does <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> mean /?
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> asked a couple law professors earlier this evening to <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">discuss</COREF> the issue with <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">John Yoo of University of California Berkeley who served in the justice department from two thousand and one to two thousand and three /.</COREF>
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's also a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute /.
Also joining us <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Alan Dershowitz professor of law at Harvard the author of a great many books including The Case for Peace How the Arab Israeli Conflict can be Resolved</COREF> /.
Also involved in <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">discussion</COREF> was <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Goodman at the Center for Contitutional Rights</COREF> /.
Here 's some of <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the conversation</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Professor Dershowitz</COREF> under what circumstances do <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">torture</COREF> is justified /?
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Torture</COREF> is never justified /.
and <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> hope <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> never have to use <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> /.
But if we ever had a ticking bomb terrorist who could under torture reveal the location of a bomb that would destroy hundreds of thousands of people <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guarantee <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> would use <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
That 's an empirical judgement not a normative one /.
And if <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> would use <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> then <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have to <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">use</COREF> <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> only with accountability /.
And <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> means that <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the president of <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF></COREF> or <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">the vice president</COREF> or <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">the secretary of defense</COREF> or the chief justice has to specifically authorize precisely the kind of extreme measures that are permitted to be used /.
<COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">No extreme measures without accountability</COREF> <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> has to be the rule /.
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Goodman</COREF> <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> believe <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's uh a slippery slope /.
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a very slippery slope /.
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think once you start to say well under these circumstances empirically you 're going to and you have to provide these kinds of measures if you do <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> then you 're basically that under <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">certain circumstances</COREF> <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can happen <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> should happen and then <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's going happen under more than <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">those exceptional circumstances</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's going to start becoming the regular rather than the unusual /.
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">Professor Yoo</COREF> let <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> bring <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> in here um /.
What do <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think about <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Professor Dershowitz 's</COREF> argument that torture under any circumstances is wrong uh and that <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> supports <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">McCain</COREF> amendment</COREF> uh but at <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> direction uh under extraordinary circumstances /.
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> agree with much of what <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Alan</COREF> says /.
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do think <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">torture</COREF> is wrong /.
<COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's illegal /.
What <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">McCain</COREF> amendment</COREF> is just repeating is the Geneva convention standard that already applies in Iraq /.
what the problem with <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">McCain</COREF> amendment</COREF> is , that <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> prevents the CIA to use interrogation methods would not be torture but would fall under this vaguer term cruel inhumane degrading treatment which is /.
But what is <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> definition of torture /?
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean uh <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> understand <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were one of the lawyers in the justice department early on who helped craft documents outlining you know what some called a before <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">nine eleven</COREF> approach and after <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">nine eleven</COREF> approach /.
And the definition of torture uh that <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> understand from what <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've read that <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were advocating was a very narrow one /.
look /.
we can all have an argument where exactly <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">that line</COREF> is /.
and <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> means <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">severe pain and suffering either physical or mental</COREF> can not be imposed /.
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> would be torture /.
See /. <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would have a broader definition of <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">torture</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would define <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> very broadly then prohibit <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
But then if it 's felt necessary to use any of these measures short of torture water boarding extreme psychological measures if <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the president of <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF></COREF> is prepared to put <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> credibility on the line and say the future of <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the nation</COREF> is stake <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> must violate the law in this instance like <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> would if <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had to shoot down a civilian airliner let <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> take accountability /.
And that would broaden <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the definition of torture</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> would n't have any of these escape valves that we now have and would place <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">accountability</COREF> squarely where <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> belongs not on the shoulders of sergeant England or some other low ranking official /.
right now <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're just being an apologist for torture /.

<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> point</COREF> is this that torture is new in the American discourse in many ways /.
We have not seen the prevalence , we have not seen an outcropping of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">torture</COREF> notwithstanding all of the wars in which <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've engaged until this current administration /.

rampant /.
And please /.
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean but is n't it true that there has always been torture /?
Always /.
There always has but not in the degree not in the level not in the amount that we have seen /.
Much worse /.
much worse /.
And the fact is that by saying that <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are going to allow certain circumstances under which <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will apologize for torture /-
Much worse in the Vietnam war /.
much worse in the Korean war /.
much worse /.
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ca n't talk without <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> /.
All right <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're saying it 's been much worse /.
Much worse /.
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">Professor Yoo</COREF> eh <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> says <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> does not <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">torture</COREF> /.
Do <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> believe <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's true /?
Yeah <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not true , that if there is <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">abuses like Abu Ghraib</COREF> occuring <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're just illegal and ought to be punished /.
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Professor Dershowitz</COREF> does the <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">US</COREF> torture /?

<COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">Just the message <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gave yesterday <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't approve torture but <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> approve doing whatever is necessary to stop terrorism /.</COREF>

<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says and <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm paraphrasing that basically the element of surprise what the <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">enemy</COREF> does not know about what we 're going to do to <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> is a very powerful tool /.
And so you do n't want to specify /.
you do n't want to write out exactly what can and can not be done /.
<COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is truly apologism for torture /.
<COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's saying that <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">torture</COREF> does work can work /.

Still ahead on Three Sixty . It may be <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">off - year elections</COREF> but <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're being closely watched /.
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">The latest results</COREF> and what <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say about the future /.
Also the crisis unfolding in France what <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the riots</COREF> and the raids behind <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> have revealed . And why <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Maureen Dowd</COREF> <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">thinks</COREF> <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">women of <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> generation</COREF> were sold a bill of goods /.
All the things <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did that <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> thought would make <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> more fascinating like high - powered careers /.
And <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> wanted <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">that snappy Hepburn Tracy dialogue</COREF> because actually a lot of guys find <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> draining /.
We 'll talk to <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> about <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> and a whole lot more /.
Be right back /.
Election returns are coming in from around the country /.
There are uh state and local races with nationally known faces and issues as well as a celebrity or two /.
With us <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">CNN 's</COREF> John King</COREF> and Jeff Greenfield /.
Let 's start with breaking news and <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">John King in DC</COREF> /.
What 's the latest <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">John</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">Anderson</COREF> more statements from <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the democrats</COREF> celebrating <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> more events planned by <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the democrats</COREF> <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">tomorrow</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> believe <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have the upper hand in <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">these off - year elections</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">The two biggest races the races for the governorships of <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> and <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">New Jersey</COREF></COREF> /.</COREF>
Democrats <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">winning</COREF> in <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">both of those states</COREF> we can show you here /.
<COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> projecting that Tim Kaine now the lieutenant governor will be the next governor of <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> winning quite handily fifty - two to forty - six percent over republican Jerry Kilgore /.
Also in <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">the state of New Jersey</COREF> John Corzine the democrat with fifty - four percent of the vote right now beating Doug Forrester the republican just forty - three percent /.
Ninety - one percent of the vote counted in <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">New Jersey</COREF> /.
Ninety - nine percent of the vote counted now in <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Two democratic victories in <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the races for governor</COREF> /.</COREF>
Republican Michael Bloomberg will <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">win</COREF> re-election in New York /.
Republicans will celebrate <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> a source of frustration to democrats /.
How much does this mean nationally /?
That race in <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">New Jeresey</COREF> was much more personally nasty about property taxes perhaps than about President Bush or any national issues /.
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> race</COREF> about the death penalty about <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">other state issues</COREF> as well traffic number one among <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the democrats</COREF> will certainly that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> race</COREF> is proof that the republican base is demoralized /.
That will be studied <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">Anderson</COREF> as we look at <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">these off - year elections</COREF> and how much <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> play into <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">next year</COREF> /.
Many state ballot questions that are of some national import <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> /.

we wo n't get the results there until <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">tomorrow</COREF> /.
A split verdict if you will on <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the issue of gay rights</COREF> /.
Texas voters adopting a Constituional amendment to finding marriage as between a man and woman /.
but supporters of gay rights winning a referendum in the state of Maine /.
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is something to watch heading into <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">next year</COREF> as well because republicans think <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> helps increase turnout among conservatives /.
And ballots of course /.
Uh the polls are still open in California /.
so we do n't know about the ballot initiatives there /.
Is Arnold Schwarzenegger 's reputation on these ballots /?

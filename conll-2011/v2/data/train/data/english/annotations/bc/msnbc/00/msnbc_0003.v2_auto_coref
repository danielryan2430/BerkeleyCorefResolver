The move comes a month before the Senate is scheduled to hold confirmation hearings on <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush 's</COREF> Supreme Court nominee John Roberts /.
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut</COREF> was among those Democrats who spoke out against <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Bolton 's</COREF> appointment</COREF> <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> just do n't think <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can do a very good job there /.
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going to hurt <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> more importantly going to hurt the country /.
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think the nomination is a bad one /.
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think the way <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's arriving there is a very bad idea /.
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">NBC 's David Gregory</COREF> is at the White House /.
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">David</COREF> <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> does n't <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> run the risk of looking like <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">the little rich kid who is not winning the game so <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says it 's <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> ball</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm going home with <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /?
Well <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have a theory about <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Chris</COREF> which is that every time somebody accuses <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> about <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">being</COREF> abrasive or abusive to subordinates or you know difficult to work with as somebody who is just going to break all the china in the place <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> says oh yeah <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is why <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> like <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the guy</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is exactly what <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want at <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm only half kidding /.
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> really think that <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is a big part of <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> that <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> uh yes <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> may be ruffling feathers here but to <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">deal</COREF> with <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> wants to do <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in a pretty hardline way /.
uh well let <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> ask <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> this about the nature of <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">the appointment</COREF> because <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can only be appointed through uh the beginning of the next session of Congress which is in early oh seven it 's really only a year and a few months /.
how can <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> really be a permanent representative and have the stature of one /?
Well <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's a big question /.
Uh <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is a question that was posed to the <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> secretary - general <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean the bottom line is that <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> has got some time to work with <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has a year up there /.
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> knows <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has got you know <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> authority /.
<COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">Everybody up there in New York</COREF> understands that as well that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can push the US agenda /.
And then we 'll see what happens /.
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean if <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can prove to some Democrats that uh <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can work well with others up there perhaps <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">changes</COREF> some minds /.
Maybe uh <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's not going to happen /.
but the bottom line is that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is not an administration that thinks very highly of <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> /.
and the only real engagement <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want to have at <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> is to try to <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">clean</COREF> <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">the place</COREF> up /.
And so <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">going</COREF> to stand by <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the guy <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> think who can really do <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF></COREF> /.
and this is very much a statement that <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> was not going to be deterred from making in terms of <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> views of <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> and how <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ought to operate /.
how big a role has <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the vice president</COREF> had in <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">this appointment</COREF> and <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">this continuation</COREF> to fight for <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to the point of naming <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a recess appointment /?
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think huge /.
And in fact it 's <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the vice president</COREF> who 's very close to <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> , who has been a real stalwart for <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> throughout this process /.
And <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think it 's perfectly clear uh that <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> made the argument to <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> that <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do n't wobble on <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">this one</COREF> , that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is an important player in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> agenda with <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> /.
Okay thank <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> very much <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">David Gregory</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Republican Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota</COREF> is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee which held the nomination hearings on <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Senator</COREF> let <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> ask <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> about the Democrats /.
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The president</COREF> referred to <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">a handful of Democrats</COREF> /.
Who is <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> talking about /.
who held up <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">this nomination</COREF> /?
Well the bottom line is that there were fifty - six votes for cloture /.
so the majority of <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the United States Senate</COREF> supported ending the debate /.
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">Bolton</COREF> would have gotten more than fifty - six votes to be confirmed /.
so a majority of <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> supported <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> /.
and in most democracies <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">majorities</COREF> actually get <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> way /.
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> procedure allows a minority to block <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">this nomination</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did /.
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">Chris</COREF> two other things /.
the bottom line is <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're forgetting there 's <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">a conference on <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> reform</COREF> <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">major conference</COREF> September fourteenth through the sixteenth /.
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The president</COREF> is going to be there make a major statement now <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has got somebody who is there , who is <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> guy , who is going to work with <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> over <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">these six weeks</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is an important period of time /.
We 've been six months without a permanent representative /.
The time was to do it now /.
and <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe did the right thing /.
Let 's listen to <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">Senator and former Majority leader Trent Lott of <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Mississippi</COREF> the United States senator from <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">that state</COREF></COREF> /.
Here 's what <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">said</COREF> that <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> opposed <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">the recess appointment of uh <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have advised against <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was not confirmed /.
And if <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> went in there <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would be limited to like seventeen months /.
Uh perhaps uh <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would not be weakened /.
but uh you know it appears to <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> that <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would /.
Uh but uh <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would recommend against a recess appointment /.
What do <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> make of <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> Senator Coleman</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> disagree with <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> friend and respected colleague Trent Lott</COREF> /.
Bottom line is that <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is an important moment /.
<COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">This UN</COREF> is reeling from the aftermath of the investigation that <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've done on oil for food /.
And <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've been reeling from the child prostitution in Africa from the sexual harassment of top <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> personnel /.
<COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> finally understand <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have got to make change /.
Uh hopefully get a John Bolton who can force the Chinese and Zimbabwe and Sudan to understand that we have got to get rid of the odious Human Rights Commission /.
And so the time is now /.
Eh <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">George Bush</COREF> is only going to be in office a couple more years /.
that 's how permanent permanent will be /.
Uh <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> will be there during probably the most important time for <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> in many many years /.
Do <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think there 's a value in <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> in <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">having</COREF> someone to go up there and just waste the place <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean in other words just give tough speeches try to humiliate <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> uh try to get <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> out and get <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> straightened out by just making fun of <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> by basically trashing some of those Third World members that have contributed to this uh horror in some of these cases <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> mentioned /?
uh <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think there 's any basis for saying <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's what <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> is going to do /.
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> by the way was a very effective assistant of state /.
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> helped <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> get <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">rid</COREF> of <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> odious Zionism is racism resolution in nineteen ninety - one when people said <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> could n't be done /.
So do n't underestimate the skill of <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> /.
Is there a time to be tough /?
Yeah /.
And <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can be tough /.
Is there a time to be persuasive /?
Yeah /.
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> can <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> persuasive /.
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's got a record of doing <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> officials themselves have said <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
Malloch Brown has said <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
Kofi Annan has said <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
So <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think it would be a mistake to simply <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> as a tough guy who is going to push folks around /.
But <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> knows how to get things done /.
<COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">The moment for reform</COREF> is now /.
and if <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> miss <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">that moment</COREF> shame on <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> might hear <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
How about an unusual leader /?
Eh everything that <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> said about <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Kim Jong</COREF> was approved by the State Department /.
There 's not a record on it not a single thing in the record /.
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> sat through all the hearings and read all the stuff /.
there 's not a single thing that <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> said that was n't approved by higher powers /.
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Tyrannical dictator</COREF> hellish nightmare on the eve of the six nation talks /?
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> what <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is /.
Oh yeah we know <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
The truth hurts so much with <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> /-
So <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> listeners understand there 's not a single thing that <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> said during that entire process that was not vetted , that was not cleared and that was not approved /.
So <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is a tyrannical dictator for whatever reason folks <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">said</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's the approach we 're going to use /.
and so <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> was n't off the reservation and was n't speaking out of school /.
<COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was speaking <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">truth</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was approved truth /.
What do <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think about <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> comment that we could <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">lose</COREF> <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">the top ten floors of <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> building</COREF></COREF> and <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would n't hurt</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">hope</COREF> <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't have an office on one of <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">those top ten floors</COREF> /.
Uh yeah <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> sound like <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Barbara Boxer</COREF> now <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Chris</COREF> /.
You know the reality <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was saying <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">that comment</COREF> to <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">a group of folks</COREF> /.
it was a meeting in which they 're talking about <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">one world government</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was saying hey <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">folks</COREF> <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not going to happen /.
Oh do n't /.
no no /.
now <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're at war /.
What did <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> just say /?
Uh <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think so /.
<COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's not going to happen /.
And the bottom line is that a lot of folks would say <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> has not been as effective as <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should be /.
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> investigation has shown mismanagement at least perhaps corruption at worst /.
Right /.
and so there are a lot of folks saying you got to make change in <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's what <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was all about /.
And <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> recognized <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> now /.
<COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's why <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're holding this meeting on <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">reform</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's why <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> is going to be speaking there /.
And <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has got <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">a guy by <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> side who can help make <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> happen</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> made a mistake there <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Senator</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> just jumped on <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> because <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">quoted</COREF> <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> saying it would be all right if they lost <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">the top ten floors of <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF></COREF></COREF> /.
and was <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wrong to do <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /?
No /.
it was a comment /.
eh eh it was n't <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> quote</COREF> /.
it was <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">your comment eh that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> said how would you feel if you were on one of <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">those floors</COREF></COREF> /.

<COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's what <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Brabara Boxer</COREF> said in one of our hearings /.
Oh did <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> say <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /?
Oh oh <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was a mistake on <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> part /.
Yeah absolutely /.
wait and the reality is again <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the context in which <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF></COREF> was very clear <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think few would argue with <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is we 're not going to a one world government /.
<COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">The UN</COREF> is not going to dictate American foreign policy and how <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> defends <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> /.
On the other hand <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need to <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">work</COREF> with <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> has showed the ability to do <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think it would be a mistake to mischaracterize <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> simply as a tough or a tough guy or a bully /.

After urging <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> not to go through with <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">this recess appointment</COREF> the reaction today from Democrats was harsh /.
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">This man</COREF> uh sadly if we had a secret roll call would not be approved by <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> /.
both in <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">the Democratic and Republicans sides</COREF> serious misgivings about whether <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has the qualifications for this important assignment /.
And some Democrats said <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> action is a stick in the eye just as <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> is preparing for confirmation hearings of John Roberts <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> nominee for <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">This president</COREF> has more disdain for the United States Congress than any president <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've seen in <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> thirty years there /.
<COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The president 's</COREF> power to make recess appointments</COREF> comes from the Constitution /.
And <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a power that dates back to <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">George Washington</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">Our nation 's</COREF> founding father</COREF> recessed <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">John Rutledge</COREF> on to <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> only to see <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> formally rejected by <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> after one term /.
<COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">President Reagan</COREF> made two hundred and forty - three recess appointments /.
<COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">President Clinton</COREF> made a hundred and forty /.

<COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">President Clinton 's</COREF> recess appointments included James Hormel an openly gay man Republicans opposed to be ambassador to Luxembourg and Judge Roger Gregory /.
<COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have tried for five years to <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">put</COREF> an African - American on the fourth Circuit for five years /.

For <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> recess appointments have gone to conservative Judges Charles Pickering and William Pryor Labor Department Solicitor Eugene Scalia the son of Justice Antonin Scalia and Undersecretary of State Otto Reich a key figure in the <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> administration 's policies toward Nicaragua /.
But political analysts say <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> is more bitterly divided now than <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has been in years /.
And the <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Bolton</COREF> nomination fight was particularly intense /.
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has a record of trying to remove intelligence analysts who disagreed with <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> also attempted to exaggerate intelligence to fit his views /.
This spring Democrats also played decade old tapes of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Bolton</COREF> disparaging <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> /.
The Secretariat Building in New York has thirty - eight stories /.
If you <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">lost</COREF> ten stories today <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would n't make a bit of difference /.
Republicans said <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Bolton 's</COREF> skepticism of <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> combined with <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hard working style would make <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a perfect choice /.
<COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">The United Nations</COREF> is in trouble /.
<COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> needs a strong voice from <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> to help reform <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">this vital institution</COREF> and make <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> uh relevant and meaningful and powerful for the time that <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> find <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">ourselves</COREF> in /.
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> is now the first US ambassador to <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> to be named through a recess appointment /.
The question is will there be any fallout at <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> or any repercussions here in <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> when the White House and <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> have to deal with each other again later this fall /?

You 're watching <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">Hardball</COREF> on MSNBC /.
Welcome back to <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">Hardball</COREF> /.
More now on <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the recess appointment of <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> to <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell</COREF> joins us now /.
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">Andrea</COREF> there are two paradigms for <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> ambassador /.
There 's <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Adlai Stevenson the old liberal who really came through during the Cuban Missile Crisis because everybody in the world believed <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was n't a hawk</COREF> /.
And then there was <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Daniel Patrick Moynihan who went over there and took on the Third World on issues like uh the issues of anti-Israel sort of rhetoric over there and <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> won those battles</COREF> /.
What are we looking at here a smart diplomat or a tough talker /?
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think a tough talker /.
But what <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needs to learn and what <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's been warned about uh from diplomats up there is that you need votes /.
And <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> ca n't go in with a mandate that <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> has given <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to shake the place up with some of those pungent sound bites and get along with enough people especially because <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own credibility was really on the line on <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">some of the tough issues that <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going to confront <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> Iraq <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF></COREF> /.
So since <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's been accused of twisting the intelligence on <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">exactly those issues</COREF> <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> needs <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">some allies</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going to have to develop <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">those allies</COREF> now /.
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> will have the Brits and some of the other traditional American allies /.
but <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't have a lot of goodwill up there /.
That said <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> has experience /.
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was very successful in a previous incarnation in New York when <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was able to defeat the Zionism is racism uh resolution there back then /.
And <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's a smart guy /.
So <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would n't bet against <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
What about <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the European and the world press</COREF> /.
are <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> going to destroy <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> before <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gets started for being a recess appointment /?
Sure but <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">Kofi Annan</COREF> look does n't have a whole lot of strength <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> especially with critics here in <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> /.
So while <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would like to warn <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> as <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did today that there are a hundred ninety other representatives <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> has a certain special clout /.
and <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">Annan</COREF> is going to have to listen to <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guess that if <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Bolton</COREF> had not said some of the things that <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had said in the past that you know the UN secretariat has <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">thirty - eight floors</COREF> and you could lose ten of <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> without losing anything those kinds of quotes are going to kind of haunt <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
Do <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think there 's any danger in the world of causing a real war in <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> again another Korean war by calling <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the North Korean dictator</COREF> what <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is /?
I mean <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> calls <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a tyrannical dictator /.
and <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says it 's a nightmare all over there /.
all true /.
But here 's <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">a guy on Jack Daniels most of the time in a world of delusion</COREF> /.
Is there any chance <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> might just rattle <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">that cage</COREF> too hard /?
Well actually <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Condi Rice <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF></COREF> in <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> own confirmation hearing had <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">rattled</COREF> <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">that cage</COREF> /.
And they 've walked way back from <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
What <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Rice</COREF> is proving as secretary is that <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's much more pragmatic as secretary of state than <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was a national security adviser on <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> and on <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF> /.
So <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's taken this posture <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's reflecting <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> view as adjusted for second term and <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Bolton</COREF> is going to have to follow that line /.
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> ca n't really go off on <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own /.
And if <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 'll reel <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> right back in /.
How many months before <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Condi Rice</COREF> has to apologize or defend uh <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> language /?
Maybe two /.
Okay thank <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> very much <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">Andrea Mitchell</COREF> /.
Two months it is /.

<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's been booed on <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> way into the building today /-
And just give <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> hell /.
look <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> is a principled guy with a lot of skills /.
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has the support of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the president of the United States</COREF> the secretary of state a majority of <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the United States Senate</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's basically going to waste <COREF ID="218" TYPE="IDENT">the other side the Third World people</COREF> and just blow <COREF ID="218" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> up every night /.
No absolutely not /.
that 's not his mandate and goal /.

<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's so good /.
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think it 's like <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">sending</COREF> Frank Rizzo to <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> /.

a tough customer a tough cop or else how about hall monitor /.

<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm talking from the subjunctive mood of <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">this administration</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean you know <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> may refer to Karl Rove as the architect /.
but to the rest of the world <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> is the architect of misleading <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> misleading the world into a war /.
um and then you know basically during <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> confirmation hearings <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was asked whether <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had ever been <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">interrogated</COREF> as part of an investigation /.
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did n't tell the truth about <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is an administration that basically is rewarding <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">somebody</COREF> for not telling the truth consistently over a long period of time and for belligerently abusing <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> staff /.
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't believe in <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> debate</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Your</COREF> party</COREF> stuck by what <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> just said about blaming <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> for the war /.

There was nothing about <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> as the architect for the war /.
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a much shriller sort of less relevant debate that <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">you guys</COREF> did /.
could n't the strategy of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> be <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> is going to be <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> lightning rod /?

Well <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> term ends in January of oh seven /.
There are <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> elections in November of oh six /.

What a standard <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're setting /.
In other words if <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get a veto uh uh uh what do you call it a filibuster proof majority /-

Will <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> end up in a simple report uh from <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Patrick Fitzgerald the investigator the prosecutor from Chicago</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't know first of all /.
but no it does n't appear like right now that there are likely to be uh indictments certainly on the leak /.

So <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're betting against perjury indictments /?
<COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would suspect no /.
Obstruction of justice indictments /.

<COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think it 's going to be perjury or obstruction if there are indictments at all /.
<COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think it 's pretty difficult to have an investigation of this length at this cost to put <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">a New York Times uh reporter</COREF> in jail for this length of time /.

<COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">Steve</COREF> what 's the charge going to be /?
<COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think you 're going to see perjury or obstruction of justice because <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> frankly do n't think that on a technical specific intent crime like the one that was originally alleged <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going to probably return an indictment because it 's a specific intent crime /.

You had energy /.
you had transportation /.
uh you 've had tort reform /.
you 've had bankruptcy bills /.
you got an economy that 's going along uh pretty well /.
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> has been an era of achievement for the president /.
And <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think you 're going to be going back looking at <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">this period</COREF> in time uh in that lens yeah /.
As fail period /.
Uh <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think the story of <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">this administration</COREF> especially this second term is arrogance and abuse of power /.
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean basically anybody who gets in <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> way <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> knock down /.
As bad as FDR in the second term /?
Worse worse <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Chris</COREF> way /-
As <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton</COREF> during <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Lewinsky</COREF> /?
Well you know uh <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've learned that <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">perjury</COREF> <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> a problem for public officials /.
and <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> learned <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> from a matter as unusual as <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton</COREF> and <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Monica</COREF> /.
But in fact <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">Ben</COREF> <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> sat on a lot of shows with <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> talking about <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">that very subject</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were singing a different tune then , were n't <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> /?
Okay <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> learned a lot tonight /.
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> say <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">John Bolton</COREF> will be confirmed by <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">the United States Senate</COREF> within a year /?
Yes /.
Well no at the end when <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> term is up /.
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> believe <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will not be /?
In early two thousand seven because <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> will be packed with Republicans by then /.
No because <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going to do such a good job <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going to deserve /-
Absolutely /.
And <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> believe there will be indictments <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">coming</COREF> out of <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">this investigation of the CIA leak</COREF> /?
Uh <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's more likely than not yeah /.
You think there wo n't be /?
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that there wo n't be of White House staff /.
Okay thank you very much /.

Welcome back to <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">Hardball</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is going to be great /.
<COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">Melanie Morgan</COREF> is a radio talk show from San Francisco 's KSFL AM five seventy /.
<COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> 's also chairwoman or chairman of Move America Forward /.
<COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> recently returned from <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> with <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">a half dozen other conservative radio talk show hosts</COREF> where <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> broadcast for a week in order to combat what <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> calls the mainstream media and liberals ' attempt to undermine <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">the war effort</COREF> with negative news /.
Also joining <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> right now is <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">Paul Rieckhoff</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's a veteran of the <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> war</COREF> and founder of Operation Truth dot org the nation 's first and largest advocacy group for <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> and Afghanistan war veterans /.
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm going to start with <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">Melanie</COREF> just back ten days ago what did <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> smell over there /?
What did <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> see /?
Well first of all it was a hundred and twenty - five degrees in the shade in <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
Um and when you 're wearing like <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was twenty - five pounds of body armor um and sweating through your clothes and trying to stay hydrated um in the middle of a sandstorm um where we were trapped on a couple of different occasions it was pretty grueling tough work and an assignment that made <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> have a tremendous appreciation of what <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">our troops</COREF> are going through on a day to day basis in <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
what did <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> get from <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraqis</COREF> /?
Do <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> like <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> /.
Do <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> dislike <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> /.
Are <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> neutral /?
Are <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> waiting to see who wins or what /?
<COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that many of <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraqis</COREF> <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">at least the ones with whom <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> spoke</COREF> felt very strongly that <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> appreciated the American presence there /.
<COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are obviously extremely <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">concerned</COREF> about the level of violence that is coming from <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">the insurgency</COREF> /.
but there 's <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">a reason for <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF></COREF> /.
and you have n't heard <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> discussed in the mainstream media because nobody has brought <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> up /.
<COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">The reason why <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are concerned</COREF> is because <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know that uh <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the constitutional referendum</COREF> is terribly important /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">the insurgency</COREF> made a strategic and tactical error by not disrupting the last election back in January /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> know that <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's coming time around /.
But if those elections go successfully as <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the American military</COREF> is hoping and planning for as well as the Iraqi army then <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are going to start discussing the possibility of drawing down <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> troops</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's something that <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> learned and reported on while <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was in <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
And it was n't until ten days later <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> finally started seeing something in the front pages of the daily newspapers /.
<COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">Paul</COREF> <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> helped fight <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">that war</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> reaction to what <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">Melanie</COREF> just said /?
Well <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think it 's great that some reporters are headed over there and trying to get a taste and a feel for what soldiers like <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> lived every day /.
And <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was there for a year in Central Baghdad /.
And <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saw the good the bad and everything in between /.
And <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">reporters</COREF> need to really continue to go outside <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> area of comfortability</COREF> outside <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">the Green Zone</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think the reality is that <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Morgan</COREF> like <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">most reporters</COREF> are really spoon - fed uh <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> experience there /.
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're provided with DOD contractors or uh military security personnel /.
and what <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get is a very narrow understanding of what the day to day life is /.
Not enough reporters are really going outside of <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">that comfortability factor</COREF> and going beyond <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> to try to experience what we as soliders experience /.
what makes <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> assume that <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">stayed</COREF> inside <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">the green zone</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's another thing that <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 've written about <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> that is a lie /.
<COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's not what <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> said <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">ma'am</COREF> /.
What <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> said was that <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> did n't get out of <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> comfortbility zone</COREF> /.
What <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> /-
If <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> could finish <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'll respond /.
<COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were there for ten days /.
And <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">got</COREF> <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> feet wet /.
and <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's nice /.
But then <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> back to your comfortable house in the civilian world /.
and the soliders stayed there /.
Excuse <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">Paul</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think if <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> really wanted a taste of that experience <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> could spend more time there /.
Excuse <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">Paul</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have spent thirty years as a correspondant /.

Many of <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraqis</COREF> were fearful because of the extraordinary level of IED improvised explosive devices that were going off and killing people /.
But here 's the fact of the matter /.
The day that <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was there uh there were <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">thirty - three young school children who were killed about six blocks away from where <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was located</COREF> because an American soldier had the audacity to hand <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> candy because <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were at the same time passing out soccer balls um at orphanages /.
<COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> talked to <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">these people</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are grateful because <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are feeding and helping to train <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">these people</COREF> to take over the responsibility for <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> government</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> saw as <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> described and everybody else knows for years <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the minority in <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">that country</COREF></COREF> were the bullies of <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">that country</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> ran <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> because <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were good smart vicious bullies /.

<COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm not uh uh uh a psychic /.

There are sixty percent troop strength now /.
um in terms of where <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are trying to attain a goal of a hundred percent readiness <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're at sixty percent /.

you can not breathe <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">democracy</COREF> at <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">these people</COREF> without <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> breathing <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in inhaling <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and enjoying and wanting <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> even more badly /.
The same question to <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Paul</COREF> /.
You know in the beginning of <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">World War Two</COREF> the worst thing that happened uh in the century uh uh <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">the French army</COREF> was bigger and more impressive than <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the German army</COREF> /.
but <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the German army</COREF> wanted to kill /.
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> wanted to take land /.
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had revenge in <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> heart /.

You know <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's the bigger question /.

Are <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> making more than <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're killing /?
And <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's the real question <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have to answer /.
And day to day what <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saw was that <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were in the macro-perspective <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">making</COREF> more enemies than <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're killing /.

by <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> occupation and also by <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> bullying tactics by <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> failure to offer economic solutions and diplomatic solutions <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> failure to have enough interpreters on the ground <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> failure to provide a secure situation /.
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've never had enough troops on the ground /.
And when <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> got to Baghdad at the outset <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> could n't provide overwhelming force to establish security /.

Should <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have gone in not gone in or gone in with greater strength /?
Of those three options what are <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> more comfortable with /?
Go in not go in or go in with greater strength /.
Ah as a solider it was not up to <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> whether or not <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> went in /.

<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> w- /-

<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think when <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> went in there and when <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> committed to doing <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> should have done <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> the right way /.
and Colin Powell called for overwhelming force /.
General Shinseki said <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> needed several hundred thousand of troops on the ground /.
and what <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> really need from the journalistic community and the administration is honest candor about where are <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> now and how long are <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> going to be there /?
And <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think when <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Morgan</COREF> <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> goes over there and cheerleads and really does n't provide an accurate analysis of the long term obstacles that <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're up against it 's disingenuous /.
Okay if <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're president last question <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Paul</COREF> should <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> send more troops over there or bring them all back /?
What should <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do /?
it depends on what you want to achieve /.
Well what do <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> want to achieve /?
But <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">think</COREF> if <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want to lock down a security situation it 's going to take more troops /.
More troops /.

the reality is you do n't /.

<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer , of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Axa - Midi Assurances</COREF> ,</COREF> pledged to retain employees and management of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers Group Inc.</COREF> , including <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Leo E. Denlea Jr. , chairman and chief executive officer</COREF> , if <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Axa</COREF> succeeds in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">acquiring</COREF> <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers</COREF> .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bebear</COREF> added that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the French insurer</COREF> would keep <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers '</COREF> headquarters in Los Angeles and `` will not send French people to run <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Axa</COREF> would also maintain <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers '</COREF> relationships with <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the insurance exchanges</COREF> that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> manages .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bebear</COREF> made <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> remarks at a breakfast meeting with reporters here <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> as part of a tour in which <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is trying to rally support in the U.S. for <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the proposed acquisition</COREF> .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">The bid</COREF> is part of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Sir James Goldsmith 's</COREF> unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial - services giant that acquired <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers</COREF> last year for $ 5.2 billion .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Axa</COREF> has agreed to acquire <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers</COREF> from <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Sir James 's</COREF> investment vehicle , Hoylake Investments Ltd.</COREF> , for $ 4.5 billion plus a $ 1 billion investment in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Hoylake</COREF> .
Any acquisition of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers</COREF> needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine states where <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers</COREF> operates , and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bebear 's</COREF> trip will take <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Idaho</COREF> , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Arizona</COREF> and New York after <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> stay here ; <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will meet with insurance regulators , legislators , industry excutives and the press .
Hearings on <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Axa 's</COREF> acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Idaho</COREF> ; Nov. 20 in Illinois ; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Arizona</COREF> ; Dec. 11 in Washington state ; and Jan. 8 in Oregon .
Hearings have n't yet been set in Texas , Ohio and Kansas .
California 's insurance commissioner does n't hold hearings on acquisition applications .
Although <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Axa</COREF> has been rebuffed by <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers</COREF> and has n't had any meetings with management , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bebear</COREF> nonetheless appears to be trying to woo <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> executives with promises of autonomy and new - found authority under <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Axa</COREF> .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Denlea</COREF> would be a member of the top management team of <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Axa - Midi</COREF> group of companies</COREF> , and would `` help define policies and strategies of <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the group</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers</COREF> was quick <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> to point out the many negative aspects <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> sees in having <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Axa</COREF> as <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> parent .
For one , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Axa</COREF> plans to do away with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">certain tax credits that have resulted in more than $ 600 million paid to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers</COREF> exchanges</COREF> during the past few years to offset underwriting losses</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Those credits</COREF> result because of taxes that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers</COREF> , as the management company , has paid , and have `` proved to be very important for <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the exchanges</COREF> , '' a <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Farmers</COREF> spokesman said .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bebear</COREF> contended that the tax cost to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the exchanges</COREF> under the revised structure would be about $ 8 million a year , which <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> described as `` peanuts .

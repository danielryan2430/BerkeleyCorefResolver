<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak</COREF> said today that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is willing to hold <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">early elections</COREF> and the decision comes as <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Barak 's</COREF> popularity is sinking in the polls after two months of violent conflict with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza .
The government is expected to negotiate a date for <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the elections</COREF> in talks with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the opposition</COREF> over the next few days .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The opposition</COREF> has recommended that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">elections</COREF> be set for May .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">The elections</COREF> would mean that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Barak 's</COREF> current term in office would end about two years ahead of schedule .

I think <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Pam</COREF> would just be convicted again /.
For <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">William Smart</COREF> to this day <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the murder of <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> son</COREF></COREF> still does n't make sense /.

This could have been prevented by a certain little divorce decree /.
If <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> wanted a divorce and <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> wanted out of the marriage all <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had to do was go to an attorney and get a divorce /.

<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">This woman</COREF> is very wrong /.

<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have peace in <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> heart</COREF> knowing that <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was n't involved in <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> except for you know the relationship that <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> had with <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Flin</COREF> which <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've already <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe you know put <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">myself</COREF> through enough behind /.

<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Senator McConnell</COREF> in addition to <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> the New York Times editors wrote in reaction to <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court 's</COREF> decision striking down the military tribunal set up to private <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">detainees being held in <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo bay</COREF></COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is far more than a narrow ruling on the issue of military courts . <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is an important and welcome reaffirmation That even in times of war <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF> is what <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> the statuette books and <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">the Geneva convention</COREF> say <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is . Not what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> wants <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to be /.
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Senator</COREF> in a broader sense is n't <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> a real rebuke out of repudiation of the broad authority That <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> 's been claiming since <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">nine eleven</COREF> /?
Well first and most importantly <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the decision</COREF> did not require <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> to release <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the prisoners at <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF></COREF> /.
Nor did <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> require <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> to close <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> /.
Correct /.
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> said that uh in order to try <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">these individuals</COREF> an appropriate thing to do would be for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> to get <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> uh to create military commission /.
Or there were two other options Both of which <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think were clearly unacceptable /.
So what <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> will be doing is creating <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">military commission</COREF> /.
And second a very disturbing aspect of <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the decision</COREF> was that <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">held</COREF> uh common article three of <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">the Geneva convention</COREF> applicable to um American service men /.
And <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> means that American service men potentially can be accused of war crimes /.
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> is going to want to deal with <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> as well when <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">enacts</COREF> <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">these military commissions</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need to do <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> soon /.
uh and so <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll be dealing with <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> in the coming weeks /.
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have time /?
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're going off now /?
Are <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> off now /?
There 's nothing more important than <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the war on terror</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think uh <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will have to act on <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> very soon either in July or in September Certainly uh in the next couple of months /.
<COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">Senator Schumer</COREF> will <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> be a bipartisan effort /?
And can you agree on the fix /?
<COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will /.
uh Look let 's face it <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">Andrea</COREF> /.
The world is a different place /.
And in <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">this war on terrorism</COREF> you do n't have set battlefields /.
You do n't have the enemy wearing uniforms /.
So to <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">change</COREF> things <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is a good idea /.
The problem is <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">this White House</COREF> has felt <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could just change things unilateral Against <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">the Constitution</COREF> against the systems of checks and balances /.
Had <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> come to <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> a few years ago on <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> guess is <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would have gotten most of what <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wanted /.
But what 's happened here , because there is such a view that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President 's</COREF> power is infinite and unchecked by anybody first time ever a President has had those kinds of views <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> keep running into brick walls In this case a Supreme Court that has generally been sympathetic to executive power /.
And so we 're going to have to not only look at <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> /.
We 're going to have to go back to the other issues as well Because <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">this ruling</COREF> undercuts some of the other things <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> has done /.
But on giving <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needs and giving <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">our country</COREF> what <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need to fight <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the war on terror</COREF> there 's going to be agreement /.
Well let 's break it down here Because <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">this ruling</COREF> does indicate to some human rights groups that <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> applies to the prisoners in secret CIA prisons to the prisoners in Afghanistan Beyond <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> /.
Are we going to see a flood of habeas corpus petitions now <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Senator McConnell</COREF> /?
Well <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think clearly <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've got to act /.
And <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm pleased to hear that <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">Chuck</COREF> thinks that <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> may be able to do <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> on a bipartisan basis /.
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think it is important to note that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">this president</COREF> has n't done anything with regard to enemy combatants that had n't been done by previous presidents /.
<COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">The Court</COREF> now has stepped eh eh into the field And said <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> must <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">create</COREF> <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">these commissions</COREF> /.
Well <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're happy to do <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm hopeful <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 'll be done on a bipartisan basis /.
But <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going to pass something that 's going to have <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> military servicemen</COREF> uh subject uh to some kind of international rules /.
Of course not /.
But <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are signatories to <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">the Geneva Conventions</COREF> /.
Why should n't <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">our servicemen</COREF> be /-
but the enemy is not a signatory to <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">the Geneva Conventions</COREF> /.
So why should <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">these uh terrorists</COREF> uh be subjected uh to something <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not signatories to /?
The good news <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">Andrea</COREF> is that <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">the Court</COREF> particularly Breyer 's decision said <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> could change <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">have</COREF> to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">change</COREF> <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think there 's disagreement on <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will /.
Security and liberty have <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">a tenuous and careful balance in <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">this republic</COREF></COREF> /.
<COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> changes from time to time And should /.
But the problem here again /-
<COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're right /.
There 're going to be hundreds of court petitions /.
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is going to create huge discombobulation /.
We 're going to be far worse off than if <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> had come to <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> originally and gotten <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> done /.
But and <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't agree with <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Mitch</COREF> here This view that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> has the sole right based on the use of military force doctrine when none of this was even discussed or mentioned <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> the wrong view /.
and <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> said <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">Andrea</COREF> could <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> just /-
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Senator McConnell</COREF> should <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> now just be closed /?
No <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> d- <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> /-
Because <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's just been such a black eye diplomatically /.
what are we going to do with <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">these people</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean we want them to free <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> so <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can come kill us again /?
Look <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> is very very likely to give <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> exactly what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thinks <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needs to continue to fight <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the war on terror</COREF> /.
And it 's important for all of us to remember that we have n't been <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT">attacked</COREF> again here at home again since <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">nine eleven</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's not an accident /.
<COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's not an accident /.
The policies that we 've pursued are protecting us here at home /.
But is <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">this <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">Court</COREF> ruling</COREF> a strong signal to <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> that <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should now agree with <COREF ID="218" TYPE="IDENT">Senator McCain</COREF> Senator Lindsey Graham and others in your party who believe that <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should go along with <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">the Geneva Convention</COREF> in terms of rules of the road for <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">our soldiers</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> is going to be very reluctant to subject American military people to potential war crimes uh violations /.
So <COREF ID="218" TYPE="IDENT">John McCain</COREF> is wrong on this /?
Well we 'll see /.
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're looking for <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> advice about what <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need to fight <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the war on terror</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> guess is that <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> is very likely to give <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thinks <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needs the tools <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thinks <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needs to protect us here at home /.
<COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think it 's quite that simple /.
<COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that there will be a careful looking again at what certain due process elements are that <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">the Constitution</COREF> and <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> has required in the past /.
But giving <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> the tool <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needs yes /.
But there 's one other thing that ought to be done <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">Andrea</COREF> given the sweeping nature of <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">this decision</COREF> not so much on the specifics of what can be done But on how it ought to be done /.
<COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've sent a letter today to Attorney General Gonzales asking that they do a review now in light of <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">this decision</COREF> of all their other abrogations of power So we avoid this mess again two years later on these other issues Whether it 's wire taps or anything else Where <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> just said unilaterally <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can do whatever <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want /.
That is not how <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> works /.

Well let <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> turn to another controversy which is the battle over <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">national security leaks</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">The House</COREF> voted this week on <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">a resolution condemning the publication by <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> and several other newspapers <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">particularly though The New York Times</COREF></COREF> /.

Representative Peter King a Republican of New York said If there is another terror attack the blood will be on <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> hands Meaning on <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">the editors and reporters of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF></COREF> and elsewhere /.

<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Senator Schumer</COREF> on January first <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> said about an earlier leak regarding the NSA surveillance that quote Whenever classified information is <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">leaked</COREF> there ought to be an investigation because <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could endanger <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> security /.

So <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would presume <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> now would agree with <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">this leak</COREF> should also be investigated /.
Well <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> certainly should be investigated /.
But <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> and others have gone way overboard /.
How so /?
um How so /?
Look we believe in a free press in <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">this country</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">The press</COREF> <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> often antagonistic or uh probing of people in power /.
We all do n't like <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's part of <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> /.
And as a founding father said when they first wrote the Constitution true to this day <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's a good thing for <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> /.
There are exceptions /.
One is if <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> harms national security /.
Now all of these statements by <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> and others are jumping the gun /.
We do n't know if <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's harmed national security /.
In fact <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've been on <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the Banking Committee</COREF> for six years /.
It is broad public knowledge stated by administration officials /-
Have <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> been briefed on <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have not been briefed privately on <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">this program</COREF> /.
but we 've had people come before <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the Banking Committee</COREF> uh publicly from <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> and other departments /.
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> has made statements , others have made statements , that <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> monitor and track terrorist financing /.
It 's been successful /.
Well /.
So that you uh look at the reports , the terrorists do n't use the banks as much /.
So to jump out front and just blast a newspaper that <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may not like that to <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> is totally wrong /.
it 's the guilty verdict first /.
And the trial /.
uh <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">Pat Roberts</COREF> has called for <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">an investigation</COREF> /.
Fine let <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> be a fair /-
<COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">The head of the Senate Intelligence Committee /.</COREF>
Yeah /.
Let <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> be a fair and down the middle investigation /.
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> guess <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> will find that national security was not compromised a jot /.
Well let <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> pick up on /-
because <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> Secretary Snow took a group of reporters on a trip to <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">Afghanistan</COREF> and other parts of the world to show off how <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were tracking <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">terror financing</COREF> /.
So <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Senator McConnell</COREF> do <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want to have it both ways /?
Do <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want to brag about <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> success record in tracking <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">this financing</COREF> and at the same time yell and scream about <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the reporters</COREF> when <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> print the source /?
Well look <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the leaks</COREF> are abominable /.
And printing of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the leaks</COREF> is certainly trouble /.
You can talk in general about what <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're doing without <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">revealing</COREF> the specifics /.
And <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think we all regret uh that <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the times</COREF> and other publications chose to do <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
And uh <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> essentially had it correctly /.
Well let <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> show you a joint statement that was on the oped pages of <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">both <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> and The Los Angeles Times</COREF> yesterday /.
The editors of <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">those newspapers</COREF> wrote the banking articles did not dwell on the operational or technical aspects of <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> but on <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> sweep The questions about <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> legal basis and the issues of oversight /.
We understand that honorable people may disagree with <COREF ID="241" TYPE="IDENT">any of these choices to publish or not to publish</COREF> /.
But making <COREF ID="241" TYPE="IDENT">those decisions</COREF> is <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">the responsibility that falls to <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">editors</COREF></COREF> A corollary to the great gift of our independence /.
<COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is not a responsibility <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> take lightly /.
And <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is not one <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can surrender to <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> /.
After <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> in fact <COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">The Wall Street Journal</COREF> <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">attacked</COREF> <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> on <COREF ID="255" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> editorial pages</COREF> Friday /.
So <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was clearly a response to <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
uh Even though <COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">the Journal</COREF> had <COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> published uh the same story about terror financing in <COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> news columns which is separate from <COREF ID="255" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> editorial pages</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Senator McConnell</COREF> has <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> and <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> conservative supporters now embarked on <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">a calculated campaign to demonize <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> and other newspapers but <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">particularly The New York Times</COREF></COREF> as a political calculus because <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 'll help in the midterm elections /?
Look eh eh newspapers are very very important in <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">our country</COREF> /.
The media is important /.
And <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have a free press /.
But <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the press</COREF> is not responsible for <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">our national security</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's the responsibility of <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> and the Department of Defense and the other agencies that look after us /.
And <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think it 's important for <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the leaders of the principle outlets in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the press</COREF> in <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">this country</COREF></COREF> to be responsible /.
And <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think uh <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">this publishing of this kind of information</COREF> is helpful /.
And nor do <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is necessary uh in um doing <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> job /.
<COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">Andrea</COREF> let <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> say a couple of things /.
First <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> asked about a double standard /.
There clearly is <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">a double standard</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's with <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> leak things <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want to leak /.
And when the Plame leak came out there was no outrage /.
there was no high dudgeon /.
In fact regardless of the criminal standard which uh special prosecutor Fitzgerald is handling it 's clear that there were leaks /.
There 's been no punishment no outcry etcetera /.
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean you ca n't have it both ways And use leaks when you want to And do n't use leaks when you do n't /.
But there 's a second point here /.
When it comes to difficult situations and clearly <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> now is one And uh <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">this administration</COREF> has a penchant for diversion and scapegoating /.
And here 's the good news the good news for <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> and <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think the good news in many ways /.
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're going to have to solve the problem in <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're going to have to solve the problem in the war on terrorism where <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">Afghanistan</COREF> is deteriorating right now /.
And <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">the American people</COREF> are tired and see through these diversions /.
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> want real solutions /.
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> want real progress /.
Let 's talk about real solutions <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Senator</COREF> Because Democrats are sharply divided over <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
</TEXT>
<TEXT PARTNO="004">
Two weeks ago <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">only thirteen <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> Democrats</COREF> supported <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the Kerry - Feingold amendment by Senators Kerry and <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">Feingold</COREF> calling for an immediate withdrawal</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> were not one of <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /.
But as <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">the party 's</COREF> Campaign Chairman for the <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> campaign</COREF> does n't <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">that amendment</COREF> make Democrats look weak /?
Not at all /.
You know what <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> job</COREF> is /?
Look <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> is Commander in Chief /.
By the Constitution and everything else is in charge of <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> got us in there /.
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's got to figure a way out /.
<COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> job</COREF> is oversight /.
<COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> job</COREF> is holding people accountable /.
so wait a second /.
<COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're going to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> to the voters in <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">November</COREF> /.
Right /.
Do n't <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> also have the job as <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Campaign Chairman for Democrats</COREF> of presenting an alternative /?
Let <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> say this /.
<COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think what <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the American people</COREF> want is for <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> to hold <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the President 's</COREF> feet</COREF> to the fire /.
Now <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did present <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">an alternative The one that a vast majority of Democrats voted for including some who voted for the other one which said <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was drafted by Senator Levin and Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> basically said <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going to tell <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraqis</COREF> in a period of time not public you do n't want to set a specific deadline that 's what the resolution did n't like that <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are not go <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">this commitment</COREF> is not open - ended and <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> better get <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> act together or <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not going to keep <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> there /.
But make no mistake about it Andrea /.
A minority party in <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> has <COREF ID="254" TYPE="IDENT">a job</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="254" TYPE="IDENT">The job</COREF> is one of oversighting accountability /.
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are not <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the Commander in Chief</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are not in charge of all of those things /.
No /.
So to set guidelines , to set a general direction the way <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did in <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">the Reed - Levin amendment</COREF> is correct /.
<COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think what <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the American people</COREF> are most upset about is the Republican Congress is not holding <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the President 's</COREF> feet</COREF> to the fire at all /.
But with all due respect when we talk about the politics of this <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Senator Chris Dodd who has said <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's considering running for president</COREF> said that in fact <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the Kerry - Feingold amendment</COREF> <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">hurts</COREF> rather than helps <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">the Democratic Party</COREF> /.
Oh <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't buy <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
And this is what <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">Senator Feingold</COREF> said to <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Tim</COREF> last week about those like <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">yourself</COREF> who voted against <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can tell <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> the one thing <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm sure of <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Tim</COREF> is <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the American people</COREF> have had it with this intervention /.
<COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do want a timetable for bringing home <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the troops</COREF> /.
And the fact <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the United States Senate</COREF> does n't get it should n't surprise <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> /.
So <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the majority of the Democratic Senate</COREF> is out of touch with <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the American people</COREF> /.
Yes <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is at this point /.
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Those who vote against bringing <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the troops</COREF> home</COREF> do n't get it /.
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're not out there enough /.
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're not listening to <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the people</COREF> /.
How do you go to <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the people</COREF> in <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">November</COREF> when <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Democrats</COREF> do n't have an agreed upon policy in <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /?
Very s- /-
But <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do /.
the vast majority of Democrats supported <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">the Levin - Reed resolution which called for a year of transition And said tell <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraqis</COREF> <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not open - ended</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would say this /.
The ball if you 're talking about <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the election in two thousand and six</COREF> is in <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the President 's</COREF> court /.
All of the debates in <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> this resolution that resolution are going to pale in significance before how things are going in <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the American people</COREF> every poll shows and it 's common sense hold <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> responsible /.

Was that a miscalculation on <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> part reflecting what <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> miscalculation was /?
Well certainly uh the taking of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> went as expected /.
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">The aftermath</COREF> has been much more difficult /.
the fact that <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's gone on a while creates the kind of debates <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrats</COREF> are having among <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> over whether <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> get out by <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">the end of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the year</COREF></COREF> or get out by next summer or begin to get out at some point /.

<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have n't been attacked again here since nine eleven /.

There 're democratic governments now in both places /.

No it is n't /.

<COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's been a fundamentally sound decision /.

uh Gentlemen there is now talk of a possible compromise which would have a two step process where you would delay guest workers for <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">two years</COREF> perhaps As long as <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> But first do the border security /.
uh <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Senator McConnell</COREF> <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 've been trying to support <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> /.

Well again <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the Democratic Party</COREF> is united in holding <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">the President 's</COREF> feet to the fire on oversight /.
But why wo n't <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> commit <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> to supporting <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">Joe Lieberman the former vice-presidential nominee</COREF> /?

<COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">Andrea /?</COREF>
Yes /.
Could <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> just say this illustrates the nature of <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrat 's</COREF> problem /.
weigh in on this one /.

Well there are a lot of people who are saying there 's a lot of harm /.
Ask the Undersecretary of <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the Treasury</COREF> Stuart Levy who is very upset about <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
Ask the Secretary of <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the Treasury</COREF> departing secretary Secretary Snow /.

Well is n't it true that in fact <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">this program</COREF> was hinted at in the <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Nine Eleven Commission</COREF> report /?

Let 's look at what <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wrote in <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> about <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> /.
Wildly overblown are <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration 's</COREF> protests that the press revelations about <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the financial monitoring program</COREF> may tip off the terrorists /.
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> want <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">the public</COREF> to believe that it had not already occurred to <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">every terrorist on <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the planet</COREF></COREF> that <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> telephone was probably monitored and <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> international bank transfers subject to scrutiny /.

Look uh <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't speak for <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">the Times</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've been in <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">the Times</COREF> for thirty years disagreeing with <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">Times</COREF> editorial policy right down the line /.
On <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">this one</COREF> <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did the right thing /.
Here we are on Independence Day weekend Two hundred and thirty years ago celebrating what was the resistance to a king who said we 're going to hang you for treason /.
And here we have a Long Island congressman happens to be named King who 's saying treason and put these reporters in jail /.
uh <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think there 's a big fundamental thing going on here now uh and uh across the board of get <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the press</COREF> get <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the media</COREF> /.
And uh look <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> used to write speeches for Spiro Agnew /.

uh uh and <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can say that <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> gives you a blip /.
uh <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> gives you a chance to get on the offensive against <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the darned media</COREF> /.
But uh in the long view of history <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a big mistake /.
But is it the /-
<COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is what <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't get /.

But <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not stupid /.
And <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't understand <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">the logic that says all of a sudden <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've discovered something <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't know</COREF> /.

How /-

<COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">Bill /-</COREF>

<COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know we have an air marshals program /.
But <COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know which marshal is on which plane /.
Yeah we established a democracy /.
we oppose a king /.
We have a president of the United States /.
let <COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> go back two hundred years /.
James Wilson said <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the press</COREF> will be free /.
No prior restraint on <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the press</COREF> /.

take a look at this piece of film /.
In <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> today we have more than our share of the nattering nabobs of negativism /.

And in fact all these many of the people getting up to lambaste the media now are also people that <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> talk to with <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> stories to vet <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> stories to say What is it in this story that you 're most concerned about /?

Why is <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> wrong <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Bill</COREF> /?
Why are <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> above the law /?
Because <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a big step toward tyranny which is what we 're supposed to be withholding /.

<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is n't a step toward tyranny /.

<TEXT PARTNO="013">
There are a lot of people who believe <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> in doing this latest story is motivated by an antibody animus /.
Is <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> making a decision that is political rather than editorial /?
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> like <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">The Wall Street Journal</COREF> <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">has</COREF> a wall of separation between <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> editorial voice and <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> front page and <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> news coverage /.
And <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's always been the case /.
Now does it uh always stay exactly the same /?
when you drive down that road it is always right /?
No it changes /.
But in this case uh <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am certain , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm really certain , that the editorial position of <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> about the war which <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> completely disagree with did not affect <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> coverage of the news /.
let <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> show you <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">a <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street Journal</COREF> editorial very unusual editorial that was uh in the paper on Friday</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> said that the problem with <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> is that millions of Americans no longer believe that <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> editors would make those calculations in anything close to good faith /.
We certainly do n't /.
On issue after issue it has become clear that <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">The Times</COREF> believes the US is not really at <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">war</COREF> /.
And in any case the Bush administration lacks the legitimacy to wage <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">John</COREF> <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't want to really put <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> on the spot here /.
But <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am /.
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Your paper 's</COREF> news columns also ran this story /.
And here you have <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">this editorial</COREF> /.
uh it really is uh a really sharp conflict /.
Couple of points on that /.
First of all <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">that editorial</COREF> was n't kidding when <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> said there <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> a separation between the news and the editorial pages at <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">The Wall Street Journal</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's for sure /.
Same with <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> /.
Secondly there is a very large gap between the ideological outlook and philosophy of The <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">New York Times</COREF> editorial page and The <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street Journal</COREF> editorial page /.
There is not a large ideological gap between the news staffs of those two places /.
And why would there be /?
Some of the top people of <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> were hired from <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">The Wall Street Journal</COREF> /.
What <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> found shocking about <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the editorial</COREF> was the assertion that <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> did not <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">act</COREF> in good faith in making that judgment /.
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know anybody on the news staff of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">The Wall Street Journal</COREF> that believes <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> certainly do n't /.

Let 's turn to <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> and <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> /.
What is the political fallout <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">John</COREF> from <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> decision</COREF> /?
is <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> something that can actually work in <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> favor because <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> pits <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the Court</COREF> according to the talk show hosts the last couple of days on the side of al - Qaeda /?
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's embarrassing uh internationally /.
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> isolates the United States /.
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's a setback for <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> philosophy /.
Politically <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could come out ahead on this In part because as we just heard <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer</COREF> say <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the US uh Congress</COREF> is going to take up very soon <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">legislation giving <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> this authority</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's a good subject for Republicans to be on /.
Dana what is it costing us diplomatically /?
<COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo /.</COREF>
Huge /.
which is the point not just on <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> But all of these programs /.
You know <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are covering <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the war on terror</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's a classified war /.
why are <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> covering <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /?
Because <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want to figure out whether <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> is going to achieve <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> strategic goals which is to defeat terrorism and to compete in the realm of ideology /.
It 's not just the tactical question /.
And on <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> has cost us a lot internationally as a defender a primary defender of human rights /.
And you have to take those things into consideration when you 're trying to win a war /.
<COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Safire</COREF> should <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> take this as a cue to just shut <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> or accept the John McCain approach now towards /?
No <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think uh <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> should follow the guideline that <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> has suggested which is go to <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> and get some kind of solid guidelines on what should happen /.
Wonderful thing here /.
Really a wonderful thing in the last week /.
Here 's a Supreme Court which put <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">George W Bush</COREF> in the presidency uh only six years ago Now pulling <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> up short and saying hey <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> got to get some oversight /.
<COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> got to get some congressional backing uh before <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> can do this kind of thing /.
And as you just saw in the beginning of this program <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">these two senators who disagree about so much</COREF> uh pretty much signaled you bet /.
first we 'll hear from <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'll backtrack /.
And <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'll say this is what kind of a military commission we need /.
And they 'll keep <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Guantanamo</COREF> /.
They 'll keep uh the most dangerous terrorists there /.
And we 'll have these military commissions /.
And uh they 'll set a good pattern for the next president And hopefully not the next war /.
Andrea the other thing <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> does politically is underscore the arguments of conservatives of why it 's important to change <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the Court</COREF> /.
You had Scalia Thomas Alito siding with <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> was saying we need some more conservatives /.
The last word to <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Bennett</COREF> /.
We only have about fifteen thirty seconds /.
Yeah <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> agree with <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Safire</COREF> /.
It 's uh in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Congress 's</COREF> court now /.
And <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need to act on it /.
But <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't agree with <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Safire</COREF> that <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">the press</COREF> has a right not to give testimony in a criminal trial /.
<COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are not above the law /.
And when you show your Pentagon Papers case please read <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">Justice Blackmail 's</COREF> decision /.
<COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said no prior restraint /.
But if people get hurt , if people get killed as a result of this <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">the press</COREF> is responsible /.
So the issue is whether people are hurt by something that had arguably been previously disclosed /.
That 's correct /.
<COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> disagree completely /.
You 're not above the law /.
<COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will respect <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> right to disagree /.
Okay /.
Well we are going to have to leave it there /.
Happy Independence Day on these themes of July fourth and our founders /.
Thank you all /.

And coming next our Meet The Press Minute Reflecting that landmark <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Supreme Court</COREF> decision thirty five years ago balancing national security and freedom of the press /.
And <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are back /.
On Sunday morning June thirteenth nineteen seventy one <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the front page of <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF></COREF> featured a photo of <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">a smiling President Nixon</COREF> escorting <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> daughter Tricia</COREF> on <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> wedding day /.
But the middle of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the front page</COREF> contained a story that through a strange chain of events would lead to <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">a landmark <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Supreme Court</COREF> case on press freedoms</COREF> And eventually to the Watergate scandal and <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Nixon 's</COREF> own resignation /.
The headline read Vietnam Archive Pentagon Study Traces three Decades of Growing US Involvement /.
The person who leaked <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the classified Pentagon Papers</COREF> to <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">The New York Times</COREF> was <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">defense analyst Daniel Ellsberg</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> appeared on <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">Meet The Press</COREF> several years later /.
And on that occasion <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> spoke about <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">the case that changed history</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Ellsberg</COREF> whatever else <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> may have accomplished or not accomplished by disclosing <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon Papers</COREF> many people I believe including <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> felt that <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> trial</COREF> would help establish some ground rules or answer some questions about the security classification system uh government secrecy freedom of the press /.
uh do <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's done so /.
or did the way <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ended just leave <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">all those questions</COREF> just hanging in the air as much as <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were before /?
<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think they 'll ever again try to convince an American jury that <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">historical documents of the kind in <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon Papers</COREF></COREF> even if <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are stamped Top secret could damage the national interest And thus come under the espionage laws /.
<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Ellsberg</COREF> wise men made the point centuries ago that liberty without order is anarchy /.
If <COREF ID="254" TYPE="IDENT">every person with official access to classified information</COREF> took it upon <COREF ID="254" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> to decide what should be made public how could orderly government be maintained /?
<COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's a constant problem /.
<COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> can never be an easy one /.
<COREF ID="251" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 'll never be able to reveal <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">such things</COREF> without risking <COREF ID="251" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> jobs if <COREF ID="251" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> superiors do n't want <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> revealed /.
Because of our involvement in Vietnam and because of what has happened at <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon Papers</COREF> and the Watergate case a great many of our youth have lost faith in our institutions /.
Have <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> never did /.
and <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm glad to say right now <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have never had more hope Not based on faith but on evidence of what <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> see these days that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">our government</COREF> is functioning /.
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Our government</COREF> is not the President /.

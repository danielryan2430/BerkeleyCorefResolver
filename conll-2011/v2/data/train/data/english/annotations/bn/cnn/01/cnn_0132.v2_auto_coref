<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Senator Barbara Boxer of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF></COREF> is in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> to support the undervote recount .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says on Election Day , exit polls in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> indicated voters <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">chose</COREF> Al Gore , and now it 's time to see if <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's true , but not everyone appreciated what <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had to say .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">something <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want to say to <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the Bush people</COREF></COREF> , and <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is , if <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were up here speaking , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would not boo <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> also wanted to mention to <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> come from <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the state that elected Ronald Reagan , who <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> revere</COREF> , and also those same people elected <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , so <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> hope that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would have the decency to allow <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> to speak .

As for the animals , when it comes to genetically engineered animals , the law 's having an even tougher time keeping pace with science .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">A U.S. company</COREF> is seeking government permission to bring genetically altered fish to America 's kitchens .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Kevin Newman</COREF> reports from <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">a Canadian province</COREF> .
For as long as <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've told stories , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">fishermen on <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">this Canadian island province</COREF></COREF> have shared tales of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> catch .
Lobster in recent years , but not too long ago , another delicacy -- salmon .
Oh , yeah , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> used to get <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">salmon</COREF> in the spring , but <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't see <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> anymore .
I think <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are pretty well wiped out .
But only two miles away , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Atlantic salmon</COREF> <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">are</COREF> thriving , and <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's an understatement .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">These experimental salmon</COREF> are on the cutting edge of the debate over genetically engineered food because <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">a company</COREF> has found a way to make <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the bigger one</COREF> use growth hormone more efficiently .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> reaches full size faster .
How old is this fish ?
You 're looking at <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">2 1 / 2 years</COREF> .
How old is this fish ?
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Same age .</COREF>
It is up to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the Food and Drug Administration</COREF> to decide if <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> will be the first genetically engineered beings to make it to your dinner table .
But is <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">that agency</COREF> also capable of judging what impact it may have on other species ?
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Senior government wildlife experts</COREF> have <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> doubts .
I think it 's asking more of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the FDA</COREF> than it should be asked to turn <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> into a wildlife agency .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">The FDA</COREF> says <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has hired experts in the field , but unlike wildlife agencies , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the FDA</COREF> keeps <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> research and evaluations secret from the public .
Laws do stipulate that there are certain types of material that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need to hold in confidence .
Which worries some who think it 's important people know if creating <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">supersalmon to feed human appetites</COREF> could threaten normal salmon .
We have shown <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">a tremendous potential to upset <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the balance of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">nature</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">The company producing <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the supersalmon</COREF></COREF> says <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can solve <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">that problem</COREF> by engineering fish that never mate , but <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the balance of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">nature</COREF></COREF> grows more complicated and controversial , the deeper man explores the power of creation .

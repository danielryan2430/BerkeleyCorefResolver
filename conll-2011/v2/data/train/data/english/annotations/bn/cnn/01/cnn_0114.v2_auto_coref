<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Al Gore</COREF> left <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> residence at the Naval Observatory today to attend to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> duties as Vice President at the White House .
In an interview taped last night for NBC 's `` Today '' show , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> said <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thought <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> chance of winning the legal battle for the presidency was 50 / 50 .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was asked if <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thought <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">George W. Bush</COREF> was trying to `` <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">steal</COREF> '' the election .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have never used <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">that word , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">that phrase</COREF></COREF> , and , in fact , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have well , in one public statement , urged <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> supporters never to use <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">that phrase</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">both <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Governor Bush</COREF> and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF></COREF> should recognize an obligation during this time when the votes are still to be counted , to try to restrain the passions of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> partisan supporters .

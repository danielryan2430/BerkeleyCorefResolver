Both vehicles which are armored can house up to twenty five marines /.
This time there were fifteen inside the AAV /.
Fourteen died /.
and one civilian translator was also killed /.
Now this occured in basically the same area where <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">six marines</COREF> were killed <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> in an ambush launched by insurgents /.
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The six marines</COREF> were snipers located on a roof looking for insurgents travelling down a smuggling route when <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF></COREF> were surrounded and killed by insurgent snipers /.
Now all of this violence has been located in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">an area known as the Euphrates river valley</COREF> /.
This is the main smuggling route for <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">insurgents</COREF> from the Syrian border into central Iraq /.
There have been several marine operations in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">that area</COREF> since May to try to shut down those smuggling routes /.
But today and <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> 's attacks show that <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the insurgents</COREF> are still very resilient /.

<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">Hardball</COREF> correspondent David Shuster</COREF> reports /.
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Tuesday night</COREF> in <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">an <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> district <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> carried by thirty points</COREF> it was a victory for <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Rebuplican anti-abortion advocate Jean Schmidt</COREF> /.
Well ladies and gentlemen we passed <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the test</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the GOP</COREF> did not pass <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> by much /.
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Schmidt</COREF> won by <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">only four percentage points</COREF> over <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Democrat Paul Hackett</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Hackett</COREF> is a political newcomer and a veteran of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> War</COREF> /.
Knock off the crying /.
There 's nothing to cry about here /.
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was a success /.
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was the closest any Democratic congressional candidate has come to beating a Republican here in more than twenty years /.
And <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> the Cincinnati Inquirer called <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the narrow margin</COREF> quote nothing short of astounding /.
The central issue was <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Hackett a lawyer and a marine reservist who saw combat during a seven month tour</COREF> bluntly <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">bashed</COREF> <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> calling <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> quote a chickenhawk and worse quote a son of a bitch /.
Who <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">says</COREF> bring it on is a cheerleader for the insurgents /.
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's dangerous /.
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Schmidt a state lawmaker who believes schools should display the ten commandments</COREF> urged voters to punish <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Hackett</COREF> for <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> criticism of <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF></COREF> /.
And the national GOP poured in half a million dollars in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">anti-Hackett</COREF> television ads /.
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> supports raising social security taxes /.
The effort according to Republicans was to help <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Schmidt</COREF> quote bury <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
But it was an extremely shallow grave /.
And political analysts say <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the closer than expected outcome</COREF> offers several lessons /.
First of all voters now appear to be more receptive to criticism of <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> approach to <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> and skeptical of blanket support like <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Schmidt 's</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> know that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're on the right track in <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> /.
and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need to stay the course /.
One analyst says that if the fourteen marines from <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> killed <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> had been ambushed last week the election results might have been reversed /.
Secondly <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Schmidt 's</COREF> close call may suggest that aligning with <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> on immigration and social security is precarious /.
And finally there is an advantage to campaigning as a political outsider /.
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm running because uh <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> actually want to go to <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> and fight for regular Americans /.
While campaigning <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Hackett</COREF> repeatedly criticized the leadership of <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican party</COREF> and argued that power brokers including Tom DeLay must be replaced /.
When <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">lawmakers</COREF> come back in September though it is a Republican who will be joining <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in Congress and a Democrat who will be staying home /.
The question is was the anti-war sentiment in <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio 's</COREF> second congressional district</COREF> a national bell weather signalling things to come /?

And <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that is a wake - up call /.
And if the Republican party uh grasps that then we will go about the business of reestablishing the line of distinction between Republicans and Democrats particularly on fiscal matters because <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrats</COREF> do n't represent change /.
<COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not saying <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want to cut taxes and grow out our economy and create jobs /.
<COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're not saying <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want a right - sized government to make sure that we check runaway state government spending and put more emphasis on the private sector /.
So <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't represent any change but the change of being from the outside to the inside /.
And so Republicans that are going to be successful next year are Republicans that show a real distinction between the status quo and getting our economy moving again by cutting taxes and right - sizing government /.

<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will be brief in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> remarks today /.
Let <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> start by telling you this <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have never used steroids period /.
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do not know how to say it any more clearly than that /.
Never /.
<COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Major league baseball</COREF> does n't agree /.
<COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">The league</COREF> <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">suspended</COREF> <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Palmeiro</COREF> for ten days this week for flunking a drug test /.
The New York Times today reported <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">a potent steroid</COREF> in <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> system</COREF> . <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The same that caused <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson</COREF> to lose <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> Olympic gold medal back in eighty - eight</COREF> /.

You have to be careful now because uh the extensions may be too extreme /.

is n't that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fault <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">Jose</COREF> if <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> never ever used steroids then <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">tests</COREF> positive . And then <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says oh <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's from a previous drug use /.
<COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> contradiction that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> created , is n't <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /?
Well <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a contradiction on one subject matter /.
On one time frame and not on another /.
There are going to be <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">many athletes who uh once this drug testing program was instituted are going to be found uh guilty</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> urine sample is going to come out positive because there will be strong metabolytes /.
But why do n't <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> just say I used /-
But that does n't mean <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not abiding by <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> /.
Okay I do n't want to interrupt <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> Dan /.
but why do n't <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> admit <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> broke <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> before so the new drug test will be found to be positive because of previous use /.
then <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wo n't be nailed again /?
It 's very simple /.
They do n't have enough information enough knowledge on how long a metabolyte lasts in an athlete 's system /.

What difference does it make whether <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> lied before and was using before and is found out now or <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's been using lately /?
Well if <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was using steroids during <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> testimony</COREF> or prior to <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> testimony</COREF> obviously <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has committed perjury and has tried to mislead <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> in an ongoing investigation /.
So uh it has uh a lot to do about what happens next /.
Would <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> like to see <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> charged with perjury uh if there 's evidence now hard evidence to a drug test that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was in fact using steroids back then before <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the testimony</COREF> /?
Because there 's only two options here as <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> point out /.
and <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> elucidate this /.
If <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's used <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the drugs</COREF> and never used <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> before since <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the hearings</COREF> that 's almost insane to think <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did that /.
Yeah /.
So uh <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> defense or the defense that <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Canseco</COREF> offered on this show <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">last night</COREF> was that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> may have used <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> a while ago in other words before <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> testified that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> never had , therefore <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's guilty of perjury /.
Right /.
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm not sure if <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Canseco</COREF> is just offering <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> opinion uh uh /.
Certainly <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Palmeiro</COREF> never contested <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">the positive result on <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">the test</COREF></COREF> /.
Uh so <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have n't actually got <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in /.
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's agreed today verbally to release <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">all the documents</COREF> /.
However <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe that <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> needs to get a similar release from the union because the confidentiality agreement is part of a collective bargaining agreement /.
so <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need to go to <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">that step</COREF> as well /.
Yeah but assuming <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> get by <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">that step</COREF> do <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> should be hit with a perjury charge /?
Well if <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> meets the requirements yes /.
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're trying to protect <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the process</COREF> /.
When <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> come before <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> and <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are sworn to testify truthfully there has to be consequences when <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do not do so /.
So <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is about the integrity of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the congressional process</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is not about going after <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Palmeiro</COREF> /.
We had <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">Ray Garibaldi</COREF> on <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">last night</COREF> who lost <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> son</COREF> to uh steroid use /.
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's an athlete /.
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was trying to make it as a young man /.

<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's really a joke if you think about it /.

Oh of course of course /.
Let 's take a look at something that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Jose Canseco</COREF> said here last night /.
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want people to understand /.
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> said this many times /.
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> attack</COREF> was never on <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">these athletes</COREF> /.
Uh <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> respect <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">these athletes</COREF> greatly /.
What <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> needed was one of <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">these athletes who <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> name in the actual book who are well known uh individuals</COREF> to come forth and say you know what <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Jose</COREF> 's saying is one hundred percent true /.
Um <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> major attack and <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> only attack</COREF> was on <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Major League Baseball</COREF> and <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the Player 's Association</COREF></COREF> because <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ought to be you know exploited and found out for uh <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">the corrupt methods <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> use</COREF> for letting steroids in <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the game</COREF> for endorsing steroids in <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the game of baseball</COREF> /.
And all of a sudden you know <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Bud Segal</COREF> <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">says</COREF> <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know anything about <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> never say anything /.
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's ridiculous /.
It 's the biggest ongoing joke on the planet right now /.
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Congressman Lynch</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're concerned about the rights of labor and collective bargaining agreements /.
And certainly many of us are here as well in this country generally /.
And uh so <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> respect <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> /.
so let <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> ask <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> this though /.
Do <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think the unions have done the job here /?
Is it fair to say that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Canseco</COREF> 's got it right by saying <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the Player 's Association</COREF> has not been aggressive in getting rid of steroids /?
Well <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a union problem /.
Why not a union /-
/.
Why is n't <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> a union problem /?
Well well /-
If <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're protecting <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the players '</COREF> rights and saying <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should n't be tested /.
You watch <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">those lawyers in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> committee</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were all over the place trying to defend eh <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the players</COREF> /.
Hey <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm a former union president <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">myself</COREF> and also an attorney that represented a lot of unions /.
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> always thought a very strong anti-drug policy was a good thing for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> union members /.
This is one case where they have <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">turned</COREF> a blind eye to what 's going on in professional sports /.
But <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's not the typical position of <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">unions</COREF> /.
No /.
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> usually want <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">a strong anti-drug policy</COREF> to make a better workforce /.
Well of course <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's also for safety reasons at the workplace /.
But let 's get back to <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">MLB Major League Baseball</COREF> /.
do <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> believe <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the whole major league uh establishment</COREF> has been benefitting from <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">all these homeruns</COREF> all these years and big muscles that produce <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">these homeruns</COREF> /?
Absolutely /.
Following the strike <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think the thing that brought people back to <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">baseball</COREF> was the big homerun contest between <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Sosa and Maguire</COREF> eh . and in a very real way <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">steroid use</COREF> /.
if <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">those two gentlemen</COREF> uh you know were guilty of <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and there 's some evidence that <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were uh <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> put people back into the seats /.
So <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">baseball</COREF> is benefitting by the performance enhancement of the individual players which makes it even more troublesome in terms of eradicating steroid use /.

<COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> had a lot of resources in a special election where there was turnout that was less than half of what would normally turn out in a normal election in a regularly scheduled election /.

<COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> love <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">the new gallop poll</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> just came out <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> shows that <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">Rudy Giuliani</COREF> has got a sixty four percent favor in this environment when everybody 's tough on politicians /.
and <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">McCain</COREF> 's down at fifty one /.
But you know <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want to ask <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've been pushing this /.
Maybe <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> feel like <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm campaign - managing for <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">Giuliani</COREF> /.
Maybe <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> should be /.
No <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm just telling <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is the best speaker in <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> now that Jesse Jackson 's not active /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's the best orator in <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> /.
And <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> looks great /.
What do <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Ed</COREF> /?
Hey and <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's a Republican /.
and if <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> runs <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's going to be a contender /.
You know <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Republicans</COREF> are very +hierarchial /.
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> tend to nominate a frontrunner /.
And right now <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think by any standard <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">McCain</COREF> is a frontrunner /.
And behind <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /-
Not in most polls /.
Most polls show <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">Giuliani</COREF> at number one /.
/.
Okay okay well give or take /.
Yeah /.
Uh but nonetheless <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would be a contender for <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> nomination no question /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> would ultimately have <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">some ideological problems</COREF> /.
but right now yeah <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's a frontrunner /.
/.
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">Bob</COREF> <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're laughing because <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> /.
But <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">parties that are in trouble and need to win and if <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary</COREF> 's the nominee , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going to need to win , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going to need the strongest possible opponent</COREF> wo n't <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> resort to a Giuliani /?
No look <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can be a contender /.
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> ca n't be the nominee /.
And <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'll tell <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> one thing /.
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Ed Rogers</COREF> is n't going to run <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> campaign /.
so <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> might as well <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Chris</COREF> /.
/.
Uh <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is somebody who is explicitly pro-choice who has been for gay rights who while you might diasgree with <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> on a whole set of other issues on those issues is more like a Democrat than a Republican /.
And the fact of the matter is that when <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the right wing of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican party</COREF></COREF> takes a look at <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and takes a look at <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> positions on values issues <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going to reject <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do n't want <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> appointing /-

<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do n't want <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> appointing /-
<COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> hate to be an old man here /.
but in nineteen fifty - two <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the Republicans</COREF> looked at probable defeat /.
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> thought <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were going to run against maybe Truman again /.
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> did n't know by then /.
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> ran <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Dwight Eisenhower</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> ran <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">a moderate</COREF> /.
How do <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Republicans</COREF> wo n't be smart enough to do the same thing to beat <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were n't a country fractured along these social issues in the way that <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are now /.
Look at what 's happening this weekend /.
<COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Frist</COREF> because <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's changed <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> position on stem cell research has been disinvited by <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the Family Research Council</COREF> to what <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're calling <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> Second Justice Sunday /.
Instead <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going to have Tom DeLay /.
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean you have a Republican party where certain lines just are n't going to be crossed /.
And <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't believe a pro-choice and even mildly pro-gay - rights candidate can be nominated by <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the Republicans</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know better than to try to forecast a race three years out particularly in <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">the primaries</COREF> <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican primaries</COREF> /.
However <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am a Republican that tends to underestimate <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary Clinton</COREF> /.
We know what <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">a winning Democrat nominee</COREF> looks like /.
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> looks like Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton /.
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> does n't look like a liberal senator from New York /.

Okay <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going to go back and look at <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary 's</COREF> numbers which <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> find fascinating</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're probably bad news for <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary</COREF> supporters /.
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll be right back with <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">Ed Rogers</COREF> and <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Bob Shrum</COREF></COREF> /.
Stay with <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> /.
When <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> return , could there be <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">a unity ticket in <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">the presidential race of <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">two thousand eight</COREF></COREF></COREF> /?
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 've a little buzz about <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> today /.

Let <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> look at <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">these <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary</COREF> numbers</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> find <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> fascinating /.
Favorability fifty three percent in <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> latest gallop poll</COREF> /.
Unfavorable forty - three /.
In other words <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> starts <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">the race</COREF> <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Bob</COREF> with a pretty high negative /.
Oh yeah but <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think for <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> to have a ten point advantage favorable unfavorable and the fact that <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's running a race with <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">McCain</COREF> and is as close as <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is in <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">this poll</COREF> <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think it 's fifty forty - five tells you that <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's actually a strong candidate /.
Now <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think that <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> probably appreciates <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">Ed Rogers</COREF> ' quasi-endorsement</COREF> /.

<COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> kind of reminds <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> of when <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">John McCain</COREF> said to <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> in two thousand please stop <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">saying</COREF> nice things about <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> /.
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's hurting <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> in the Republican primaries /.
Right /.

Do <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's the strongest Democratic candidate for <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">two thousand and eight</COREF> <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Bob Shrum</COREF> /?
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think we do n't know the answer to that yet /.

<COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">Ed Rogers</COREF> do <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary Clinton</COREF> could take uh <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the beefier uh industrial states where the men have votes and guns and tend to like traditional women like <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Michigan</COREF> like Illinois like Pennsylvania</COREF> /?
Yeah /.
Do <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would like <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary Clinton</COREF> the cut of <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> jib out there /?
